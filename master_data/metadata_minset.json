Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. </li><li>Time-use activity classification.

Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. </li><li>Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.</li></ol><ol><li>Diary versus stylized time-use survey.

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. </li><li>Time-use activity classification.

Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. </li><li>Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.</li></ol><ol><li>Diary versus stylized time-use survey.

Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants only or (2) average time spent for all population of certain age. In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. All statistics presented in the Minimum Set on Gender Indicators on time spent in various activities are averages based on all total relevant population. This type of averages can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both.  Data presented for this indicator are expressed as an average per day. It is averaged over seven days of the week (weekdays and weekends are not differentiated). Thus, for paid work, a five-day work week averaging seven hours per day would show up as an average of five hours of paid work per day (35 hours divided by 7 days).",

Time spent on domestic/unpaid work assesses intra-household allocation of time. It can help analysis study the nature and extent of intra-household inequality and the impact of that inequality. Having information about the way time is allocated among the various members of a household helps policy makers understand which household members will be most directly affected by a policy modification.  International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: (a) diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. (b) Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. (c) Time-use data presented refer to the \u201cmain activity\u201d only. Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. (d) The different age groups used by countries for their data collection and compilation also makes time use data incomparable across countries.",

Other possible sources include population censuses and official estimates. The ILO has made an intensive effort to assemble data on the indicators for as many countries, areas and territories as possible. Where there is no information for a country, it is usually because the country involved was not in a position to provide information for the indicator. Even when information for an indicator was available, it may not have been sufficiently current or may not have met other qualifications established for inclusion in the Key Indicators of the Labour Market, on which the information for participation rates is based. In compiling the KILM, the ILO concentrates on bringing together information from international repositories. In other words, the KILM team rarely collects information directly from national sources, but rather takes advantage of existing compilations held by various organizations, such as the following: International Labour Office (Department of Statistics ILOSTAT database), United Nations Statistics Division, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information maintained by these organizations has generally been obtained from national sources or is based on official national publications. Whenever information was available from more than one repository, the information and background documentation from each repository was reviewed in order to select the information most suitable for inclusion, based on an assessment of the general reliability of the sources, the availability of methodological information and explanatory notes regarding the scope of coverage, the availability of information by sex and age, and the degree of historical coverage. Occasionally, two data repositories have been chosen and presented for a single country, any resulting breaks in the historical series are duly noted. For countries with less-developed labour market information systems, such as those in some developing economies, information may not be easily available to policy-makers and the social partners, and even less so to international organizations seeking to compile global data sets. Many of these countries, however, do collect labour market information through household and establishment surveys, population censuses and administrative records, so that the main problem remains the communication of such information to the global community. In this situation, the ILO Labour Market Indicators Library (LMIL) programme can help. The LMIL is a system for sharing information between the ILO regional offices and headquarters. ILO regional offices are closer to the original micro-sources of data and have therefore been successful in filling in numerous gaps where data at headquarters \u2013 used in the production of the KILM \u2013 had not existed. It is an ongoing programme that continues to assist the KILM and other ILO publications and research programmes in the expansion of its country and yearly coverage of indicators. In principle, the data are not adjusted, as they are collected through a standard questionnaire, and reported in line with the international classifications. All departures from the international standard definitions and classifications are indicated in notes.",

Even when information for an indicator was available, it may not have been sufficiently current or may not have met other qualifications established for inclusion in the Key Indicators of the Labour Market, on which the information for participation rates is based. In compiling the KILM, the ILO concentrates on bringing together information from international repositories. In other words, the KILM team rarely collects information directly from national sources, but rather takes advantage of existing compilations held by various organizations, such as the following: International Labour Office (Department of Statistics ILOSTAT database), United Nations Statistics Division, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information maintained by these organizations has generally been obtained from national sources or is based on official national publications. Whenever information was available from more than one repository, the information and background documentation from each repository was reviewed in order to select the information most suitable for inclusion, based on an assessment of the general reliability of the sources, the availability of methodological information and explanatory notes regarding the scope of coverage, the availability of information by sex and age, and the degree of historical coverage. Occasionally, two data repositories have been chosen and presented for a single country, any resulting breaks in the historical series are duly noted. For countries with less-developed labour market information systems, such as those in some developing economies, information may not be easily available to policy-makers and the social partners, and even less so to international organizations seeking to compile global data sets. Many of these countries, however, do collect labour market information through household and establishment surveys, population censuses and administrative records, so that the main problem remains the communication of such information to the global community. In this situation, the ILO Labour Market Indicators Library (LMIL) programme can help. The LMIL is a system for sharing information between the ILO regional offices and headquarters.

The concept at work refers to persons who during the reference period performed some work for wage or salary, in cash or in kind (for paid employment), or persons who during the reference period performed some work for profit or family gain, in cash or in kind (for self-employment). For operational purposes, the notion \"some work\" may be interpreted as work for at least one hour.

Other possible sources include population censuses, establishment surveys and official estimates. The ILO has made an intensive effort to assemble data on the indicators for as many countries, areas and territories as possible. Where there is no information for a country, it is usually because the country involved was not in a position to provide information for the indicator. Even when information for an indicator was available, it may not have been sufficiently current or may not have met other qualifications established for inclusion in the Key Indicators of the Labour Market, on which the information for employment by status is based. In compiling the KILM, the ILO concentrates on bringing together information from international repositories. In other words, the KILM team rarely collects information directly from national sources, but rather takes advantage of existing compilations held by various organizations, such as the following: International Labour Office (Department of Statistics ILOSTAT database), United Nations Statistics Division, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information maintained by these organizations has generally been obtained from national sources or is based on official national publications. Whenever information was available from more than one repository, the information and background documentation from each repository was reviewed in order to select the information most suitable for inclusion, based on an assessment of the general reliability of the sources, the availability of methodological information and explanatory notes regarding the scope of coverage, the availability of information by sex and age, and the degree of historical coverage. Occasionally, two data repositories have been chosen and presented for a single country, any resulting breaks in the historical series are duly noted. For countries with less-developed labour market information systems, such as those in the developing economies, information may not be easily available to policy-makers and the social partners, and even less so to international organizations seeking to compile global data sets. Many of these countries, however, do collect labour market information through household and establishment surveys, population censuses and administrative records, so that the main problem remains the communication of such information to the global community. In this situation, the ILO Labour Market Indicators Library (LMIL) programme can help. The LMIL is a system for sharing information between the ILO regional offices and headquarters. ILO regional offices are closer to the original micro-sources of data and have therefore been successful in filling in numerous gaps where data at headquarters \u2013 used in the production of the KILM \u2013 had not existed. It is an ongoing programme that continues to assist the KILM and other ILO publications and research programmes in the expansion of its country and yearly coverage of indicators. In principle, the data are not adjusted, as they are collected through a standard questionnaire, and reported in line with the international classifications. All departures from the international standard definitions and classifications are indicated in notes.",

It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can</p><p>be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.</p>  Concepts: <p>Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age (usually persons aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) \u201cnot in employment\u201d is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to \u201cseek employment\u201d refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise\u2019s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d) \u201ccurrently available\u201d serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups).</p><p>Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually persons aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. They comprise: (a) employed persons \u201cat work\u201d, i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour; (b) employed persons \u201cnot at work\u201d due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements (such as shift work, flexitime and compensatory leave for overtime)</p><p>The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Even though in most developed countries the unemployment rate continues to prove its usefulness as an important indicator of labour market performance, and specifically, as a key measure of labourunderutilization, in many developing countries, however, the significance and meaning of the unemployment rate could be questioned. In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess labour underutilization.</p>",

In a country where the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one it may be concluded that the problem of unemployment is not specific to youth but is country-wide. When both indicators are high young people suffer more difficulties in finding a job than adults. The problem of unemployment is unequally distributed when in addition to a high youth unemployment rate the proportion of youth unemployment in total unemployment is high. In this case employment policies might usefully be directed towards easing the entry of young people into the world of work. Information on youth unemployment by sex shows the difficulty to enter the labour market by gender revealing in some cases a harder situation for women which is directly linked to a country''s social and cultural aspects and traditions.",

Earnings exclude employers\u2019 contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. </p><p>For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees\u2019 gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. </p><p>As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>The variety of possible sources for statistics on earnings greatly hinders international comparability, as each type of source has its own coverage, scope and characteristics.

                        "METADATA_DESCRIPTION": "The youth unemployment rate is the proportion of the youth labour force that is unemployed. Young people are defined as persons aged between 15 and 24. The unemployed comprise all persons of working age who were: a) without work during the reference period, i.e. were not in paid employment or self-employment, b) currently available for work, i.e. were available for paid employment or self-employment during the reference period, and c) seeking work, i.e. had taken specific steps in a specified recent period to seek paid employment or self-employment. For purposes of international comparability, the period of job search is often defined as the preceding four weeks, but this varies from country to country. The specific steps taken to seek employment may include registration at a public or private employment exchange, application to employers, checking at worksites, farms, factory gates, market or other assembly places, placing or answering newspaper advertisements, seeking assistance of friends or relatives, looking for land, building, machinery or equipment to establish own enterprise, arranging for financial resources, and applying for permits and licences. Although the 13th ICLS recommendations allowed in some cases to apply a relaxed definition of unemployment, the resolution adopted by the 19th ICLS defines persons who were not in employment, were currently available and wanted employment but did not carry out activities to seek employment as \"available potential jobseekers\" within the potential labour force. Thus, for the purpose of international comparability the strict definition of unemployment should be applied (i.e., people who met all three criteria during the reference period). For more detailed information, please refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 2013): http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm",

In a country where the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one, it may be concluded that the problem of unemployment is not specific to youth, but is country-wide. When both indicators are high, young people suffer more difficulties in finding a job than adults. The problem of unemployment is unequally distributed when, in addition to a high youth unemployment rate, the proportion of youth unemployment in total unemployment is high. In this case, employment policies might usefully be directed towards easing the entry of young people into the world of work. Information on youth unemployment by sex shows the difficulty to enter the labour market by gender, revealing in some cases a harder situation for women, which is directly linked to a country''s social and cultural aspects and traditions.",

                        "METADATA_DESCRIPTION": "Household labour force surveys are generally the most comprehensive and comparable sources for employment statistics. Other possible sources include population censuses, official estimates and administrative records such as employment office records and social insurance statistics. The ILO has made an intensive effort to assemble data on the indicators for as many countries, areas and territories as possible. Where there is no information for a country, it is usually because the country involved was not in a position to provide information for the indicator. Even when information for an indicator was available, it may not have been sufficiently current or may not have met other qualifications established for inclusion in the Key Indicators of the Labour Market, on which the information for youth unemployment is based. In compiling the KILM, the ILO concentrates on bringing together information from international repositories. In other words, the KILM team rarely collects information directly from national sources, but rather takes advantage of existing compilations held by various organizations, such as the following: International Labour Office (Department of Statistics ILOSTAT database), United Nations Statistics Division, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information maintained by these organizations has generally been obtained from national sources or is based on official national publications. Whenever information was available from more than one repository, the information and background documentation from each repository was reviewed in order to select the information most suitable for inclusion, based on an assessment of the general reliability of the sources, the availability of methodological information and explanatory notes regarding the scope of coverage, the availability of information by sex and age, and the degree of historical coverage. Occasionally, two data repositories have been chosen and presented for a single country, any resulting breaks in the historical series are duly noted. For countries with less-developed labour market information systems, such as those in the developing economies, information may not be easily available to policy-makers and the social partners, and even less so to international organizations seeking to compile global data sets. Many of these countries, however, do collect labour market information through household and establishment surveys, population censuses and administrative records, so that the main problem remains the communication of such information to the global community. In this situation, the ILO Labour Market Indicators Library (LMIL) programme can help. The LMIL is a system for sharing information between the ILO regional offices and headquarters. ILO regional offices are closer to the original micro-sources of data and have therefore been successful in filling in numerous gaps where data at headquarters \u2013 used in the production of the KILM \u2013 had not existed. It is an ongoing programme that continues to assist the KILM and other ILO publications and research programmes in the expansion of its country and yearly coverage of indicators. In principle, the data are not adjusted, as they are collected through a standard questionnaire, and reported in line with the international classifications. All departures from the international standard definitions and classifications are indicated in notes.",

However, not every person uses, or owns a mobile-cellular telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy, including for professional purposes. A number of studies have highlighted the link between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth.</p><p>Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that less women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the importance of mobile phone ownership to track and to improve gender equality, and monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender divide. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Task Group on Gender of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development.</p>  Concepts: <p>An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included. Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded. Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that has been used in the last three months.</p><p>A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which provides access to the PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems and technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid subscriptions and prepaid accounts are included.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>While the data on the \u2018proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone\u2019 currently only exist for very few countries, ITU is encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national household surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development\u2019s Core List of Indicators. The number of countries with official data for this indicator is expected to increase in the near future.</p>",

A mobile phone could substitute for an office or even a bank account. However, one of the limitations of this indicator is that it refers to use of the device, regardless whether it is owned or not by the person, it can be for instance borrowed from the husband or the service bought in a public phone service. Having access through sharing or borrowing rather than owning often entails dependency relationships. Since an ownership indicator is not (yet) broadly collected, use of mobile phones remains a good source of information for policy making and certainly provides a better picture for tracking gender issues than, for instance, an indicator on mobile subscriptions.",

Countries and territories are asked to report population counts by literacy status (total, literate, illiterate and not specified), disaggregated by five-year age group, sex and location (urban or rural). The data are typically reported by national statistical offices or agencies with special responsibility for literacy or adult education.  Population censuses are the primary source of basic literacy data. These data are usually collected together with other population and household characteristics concerning an individual\u2019s educational, demographic and socio-economic status. The literacy status is generally based on proxy-declaration (i.e. one person, usually the head of the household, indicates whether each member of the household is literate or not). The literacy definition may vary from one country to another.  National sample surveys are a second source of literacy data and involve the use of a literacy variable in a household or individual sample survey. These surveys are often designed to meet immediate data needs and do not always include systematic strategies for repeated data collection in future years and therefore they may not be a consistently reliable data source over time. International sample surveys, such as UNICEF\u2019s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) or the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), are a third source and involve the use of a literacy variable in a household or individual sample survey. These surveys are designed to meet commonly agreed upon international data needs while also providing data for national policy purposes. These surveys are implemented on a regular basis in selected countries. They aim to assure cross-national comparability although they often integrate national modules to suit specific country data needs. Modules from international surveys are sometimes added to other on-going national sample surveys. The UIS conducts internal consistency checks in order to ensure the accuracy of the data provided. This is done by comparing literacy data for a country from different sources, across different years, and across countries in the same region.",

Countries for which no observed literacy data are available are indicated as \u201cdata not available\u201d. The UIS uses the Global Age-Specific Literacy Projections (GALP) model to produce estimates and forecasts of literacy/illiteracy rates for years without observed data. Further information on this methodology is available at the UIS website (www.uis.unesco.org). UNSD extracts this series directly via the UNESCO data portal using API. During the calculation of regional averages, imputation of literacy rates at the national level is used for countries without any observed data. In some cases, data for an individual country or territory have not been available for many years, yet to ignore the country in the calculation of a regional average may produce a figure that is not representative of the region. The UIS is engaged in ongoing efforts to improve its methodology in order to provide representative regional figures of the literacy rate. When counts of the population are reported as \"age unknown\" or \"literacy status not specified\", these data are removed during the processing of the questionnaire and not included in the calculation of literacy and illiteracy rates. When the counts of the population with unknown age or literacy status exceed a certain threshold (usually 10% of the total population), no literacy data are reported for the country. Research indicates that educational attainment is not a reliable predictor of literacy levels and the UIS does therefore not accept literacy data derived from data on educational attainment.",

An estimate of the population in the official entrance age to primary education (if neither UNPD nor the country itself can provide estimates of their own) In all cases there is an attempt, in the first instance, to base estimates on evidence from the country itself (eg information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via correspondence, publications or data on the ministry\u2019s or National Statistical Offices (NSO\u2019s) Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other organisations). These figures may be published: as observed data (if the missing items are found in national source or the country submits them), as national estimates (if the country is persuaded to produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data) or as UIS estimates (if the estimates are made by the UIS). Population estimates by age for countries with small population \u2013 produced only where there are no other suitable estimates available either from UNPD or from the country itself \u2013 are made only for countries which have reported education data to the UIS and for which population estimates from a reliable source are available in some years.",

These data are gathered through questionnaires sent annually to countries which are typically completed by ministries of education and/or national statistical offices. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in ISCED to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators. The data received by UIS are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors & inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual \u201ccountry review\u201d of indicators. National data derived from administrative records are not necessarily based on the same classification over time and may not be comparable with data for other countries, unless exactly the same classification is used. Enrolments data compiled by UNESO are adjusted to be consistent with the ISCED and are therefore comparable across countries. The UIS also, if necessary, adjusts nationally reported data in order to take account either of under-reporting (i.e. data gaps) or over-reporting (i.e. inclusion of education programmes not covered by its surveys) before calculating indicators. In such cases, the results \u2013 if published \u2013 will normally be designated as UIS estimates (denoted by ** in UIS publications).",

To account for over- or under-reporting, for example: (i) To exclude enrolments and repeaters in other programmes which have been reported together with enrolments at the primary level, (ii) To include repeaters'' enrolments in a type of education \u2013 such as private education or special education \u2013 not reported by the country, and/or (iii) To include and repeaters enrolments in a part of the country not reported by the country. In all cases there is an attempt, in the first instance, to base estimates on evidence from the country itself (e.g. information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via correspondence, publications or data on the ministry\u2019s or National Statistical Offices (NSO\u2019s) Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other organisations).

Countries and territories are asked to report counts of the population by the highest level of education attained, disaggregated by five-year age group, sex and location (urban or rural). The data are usually reported by national statistical offices. Population and housing censuses are an important source of attainment data. These data are usually collected together with other household characteristics concerning an individual\u2019s educational, demographic and socio-economic status. The attainment status can be collected through self- or household declaration. In the former case, each household member above a certain age reports his or her own level of educational attainment. In the latter case, one person, usually the head of the household, indicates the highest qualification held or level of education completed of each member of the household. Data are usually mapped to the ISCED levels post-enumeration. National sample surveys, especially labour force surveys, are another source of attainment data. If such surveys are not regularly repeated they may not be a consistently reliable data source over time. International sample surveys, such as UNICEF\u2019s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), are a third source. These surveys are designed to meet commonly agreed upon international data needs while also providing data for national policy purposes. Modules on attainment are often standardized across countries to be internationally comparable and may not collect very detailed data. These surveys are implemented on a regular basis in selected countries. They aim to assure cross-national comparability although they often integrate national modules to suit specific country data needs. Modules from international surveys are sometimes added to other on-going national sample surveys. The UIS conducts internal consistency checks in order to ensure the accuracy of the data provided. This is done by comparing attainment data for a country from different sources, across different years, and across countries in the same region.",

Countries and territories are asked to report counts of the population by the highest level of education attained, disaggregated by five-year age group, sex and location (urban or rural). The data are usually reported by national statistical offices. Population and housing censuses are an important source of attainment data. These data are usually collected together with other household characteristics concerning an individual\u2019s educational, demographic and socio-economic status. The attainment status can be collected through self- or household declaration. In the former case, each household member above a certain age reports his or her own level of educational attainment. In the latter case, one person, usually the head of the household, indicates the highest qualification held or level of education completed of each member of the household. Data are usually mapped to the ISCED levels post-enumeration. National sample surveys, especially labour force surveys, are another source of attainment data. If such surveys are not regularly repeated they may not be a consistently reliable data source over time. International sample surveys, such as UNICEF\u2019s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), are a third source. These surveys are designed to meet commonly agreed upon international data needs while also providing data for national policy purposes. Modules on attainment are often standardized across countries to be internationally comparable and may not collect very detailed data. These surveys are implemented on a regular basis in selected countries. They aim to assure cross-national comparability although they often integrate national modules to suit specific country data needs. Modules from international surveys are sometimes added to other on-going national sample surveys. The UIS conducts internal consistency checks in order to ensure the accuracy of the data provided. This is done by comparing attainment data for a country from different sources, across different years, and across countries in the same region.",

                        "METADATA_DESCRIPTION": "Definition: <p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who desire either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next child and who are currently using a modern contraceptive method.</p>  Rationale: <p>The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies , which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are generally considered as very low.</p>  Concepts: <p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning. </p><p>Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used. Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age, either married or in a union, who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception.</p><p>For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by \u201ccurrently using\u201d a method of contraception.</p><p>In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (according to method, age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analyzing trends over time.</p><p>When data on married or in-union women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for the next most comparable group of persons is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), ever-married women, or men and women who are married or in a union. Notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or where data pertain to populations that are not representative of all married or in-union women of reproductive age.</p>",

The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning). Estimates are with respect to women who are married or in a union.</p>  Indicator 32a refers to national data while indicator 32b contains estimates from UN Population Division. Estimates are obtained from a systematic and comprehensive set of annual, model-based estimates and projections for a collection of family planning indicators, including contraceptive prevalence, the unmet need for family planning and the demand for family planning satisfied by use of contraception (any method or modern methods alone). All results pertain to married or in-union women and cover the period from 1970 to 2030. Estimates are provided for 185 countries or areas. The results are based on data available as of February 2018. A Bayesian hierarchical model combined with country-specific time trends was used to generate the estimates, projections and uncertainty assessments. The model accounts for differences by data source in the characteristics of the sample population and in the contraceptive methods included in survey-based estimates of prevalence. Details of the methodology are described in: Alkema L., V. Kantorova, C. Menozzi and A. Biddlecom (2013).

Shortfalls in women\u2019s empowerment are closely intertwined with shortfalls in reproductive rights. Gender discrimination can negatively influence health systems, for instance, so that women cannot access the reproductive health services and information, including family planning, and might be limited in their choices of types of contraception. At the household level, when women are not involved in household decision-making or are subjected to gender-based violence, they may have little control over their reproductive life, including use of contraceptives. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to preventing unintended pregnancies, which are at higher risks of poor maternal and child health outcomes.",

The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B-splines bias-reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under-five mortality for all countries. See references for details. </p><p>For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:</p><p>Civil registration: The under-five mortality rate can be derived from a standard period abridged life table using the age-specific deaths and mid-year population counts from civil registration data to calculate death rates, which are then converted into age-specific probabilities of dying.</p><p>Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on a summary birth history, a series of questions asked of each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under-five and infant mortality rates. Censuses often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.</p><p>Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from full birth history module.</p>",

Thus, equal rates of under-five mortality for boys and girls would actually be considered an indication that girls are suffering disadvantage in survival._x000D_ The effects of gender discrimination on child survival become more apparent after early infancy, because nutrition and medical interventions are more important determinants of survival among older infants and young children. Because of the relative weight of neonatal deaths in overall under-five mortality, girls\u2019 advantage in the neonatal period may mask disadvantage in later ages when considering the under-five mortality rate. To better assess gender differences in mortality among children under-five, it is preferable to disaggregate mortality rates by age, considering separately mortality under age one (infant mortality) and at ages 1-4.",

Countries often use a single source as their official estimates or apply methods different from the UN IGME methods to derive estimates. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data has good quality.</p><p>Many countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the last several decades. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of under-five mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. Each new survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, including previous data. Data suffer from sampling or non-sampling errors (such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of child deaths is also common). UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Furthermore, the latest data produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also projects estimates to a common reference year. In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. Applying a consistent methodology also allows for comparisons between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. UN IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses original empirical data from each country but does not report figures produced by individual countries using other methods, which would not be comparable to other country estimates.</p>",

Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases, household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.</p><p>Civil registration</p><p>Civil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of the under-five and infant mortality rates from civil registration data is derived from a standard period abridged life table. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.</p><p>Population census and household survey data</p><p>The majority of survey data comes in one of two forms: the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death; and the summary birth history (SBH), whereby women are asked only about the number of their children ever born and the number that have died (or equivalently the number still alive).</p>  Collection process: <p>For under-five mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publically and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO. </p><p>Adjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of under-five mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UNIGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the under-five mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data, UN IGME adjusts the estimates for crisis mortality.</p><p>Then the UN IGME conducts an annual country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, and notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices and to Ministries of Health or relevant agencies for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or relevant agencies review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data, send feedback or comments, and sometimes supply additional empirical data .</p><p>To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal: CME Info (www.childmortality.org). It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, CME Info will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates.</p>",

Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates.</p><p>For example: </p><p>The estimated 2015 global MMR is 216 (UI 207 to 249)</p><p>This means:</p><p>\u2022 The point-estimate is 216 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 207 to 249.</p><p>\u2022 There is a 50% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 216, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 216.</p><p>\u2022 There is an 80% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies between 207 and 249.</p><p>\u2022 There is still a 10% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 249, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 207.</p><p>Other accurate interpretations include:</p><p>\u2022 We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is at least 207.</p><p>\u2022 We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is 249 or less.</p><p>The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width of an indicator\u2019s UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicator\u2019s true value lies close to the point-estimate.</p>  Concepts: <p>Definitions related to maternal death in ICD-10</p><p>Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental causes.</p><p>Pregnancy-related death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.</p><p>Late maternal death: The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days, but less than one year after termination of pregnancy</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:</p><p>i. The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.</p><p>ii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).</p><p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.</p><p>By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population (see Box A2.2). An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15\u201349 years.</p><p>Related Statistical measures of maternal mortality</p><p>Maternal mortality ratio (MMR): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.</p><p>Maternal mortality rate (MMRate): Number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age.</p><p>Adult lifetime risk of maternal death: The probability that a 15-year-old woman will die eventually from a maternal cause.</p><p>The proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM): The number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among women aged 15\u201349 years.</p>",

When disaggregated by relevant socio-economic and geographic stratifiers, the indicator helps identified areas and groups that are not being reached with appropriate delivery care. The indicator, however, indicates only contact with a qualified health personnel and does not provide an indication of the quality of care provided or whether women receive all necessary interventions.</p>  Concepts: <p>The joint Statement by WHO/ICM/FIGO defines the skilled birth attendant as \u201can accredited health professional \u2014 such as a midwife, doctor or nurse \u2014 who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal (uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and in the identification, management and referral of complications in women and newborns\u201d.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Although the indicator has been measured and reported on for decades at country, regional and global level, data to measure it remain challenged with many limitations. Most data from low and middle income countries are from household surveys and therefore based on women\u2019s recall of the health worker who mainly assisted with delivery and their perception of the type of cadre (whether doctor, nurse, midwife or other). In addition, definition of skilled health personnel varies largely across countries, and includes non-standard list of cadres of health workers, which can lead to serious misclassification in terms of skills. Furthermore, categories of cadres of health workers used in survey questions are not standard but vary across surveys and between countries. Finally, the indicator only provides an indication of level of contact with the health system. It does not indicate level of quality of care, nor receipt of all necessary high impact interventions.</p>",

Nationally representative household surveys include surveys such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS, mics.unicef.org) and the USAID-funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS, dhsprogram.com). These surveys use nationally representative samples based on a two-stage cluster sampling, generally using a population census frame of enumeration areas. Final sample size includes several thousand households. Interviews are carried out with head of households, all women of reproductive age (generally 15-49) and, in the case of MICS, mothers/caretakers of children under-five. Denominator for the indicator is based on all live births reported by women of reproductive age on period up to five years preceding the survey. Despite slight variation in the determination of the denomination between surveys (for example, MICS uses last live births in the past two years while DHS uses all lives births in the past five years), the level of the indicator has been fairly comparable across surveys and overtime. </p><p>Data from health facility records are reliable only in countries where almost all deliveries occur in health facilities, resulting in generally very high level of births attended by skilled health personnel.</p>  Collection process: <p>UNICEF has established a web-based data source identification and data compilation system working with all countries offices. Data reported through nationally representative surveys (e.g. DHS and MICS) are compiled and carefully reviewed to ensure sound survey methodology, consistency definition, and accurate method of computation. The web-based system is complemented by an online search carried out by WHO of survey reports and data published in countries. Adjustment may be made to the reported value of the indicator to ensure consistency with the definition. In these cases, data presented in survey reports may be different from those reported in the global databases.</p>",

There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of SDG Target 3.a \u201cStrengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate\u201d.</p>  Concepts: <p>Tobacco use means use of smoked and/or smokeless tobacco products. \u201cCurrent use\u201d means use within the previous 30 days at the time of the survey, whether daily or non-daily use.</p><p>Tobacco products means products entirely or partly made of the leaf tobacco as raw material intended for human consumption through smoking, sucking, chewing or sniffing. </p><p>\u201cSmoked tobacco products\u201d include cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, cheroots, bidis, pipes, shisha (water pipes), roll-your-own tobacco, kretek and any other form of tobacco that is consumed by smoking.</p><p>\"Smokeless tobacco product\" includes moist snuff, creamy snuff, dry snuff, plug, dissolvables, gul, loose leaf, red tooth powder, snus, chimo, gutkha, khaini, gudakhu, zarda, quiwam, dohra, tuibur, nasway, naas, naswar, shammah, toombak, paan (betel quid with tobacco), iq\u2019mik, mishri, tapkeer, tombol and any other tobacco product that consumed by sniffing, holding in the mouth or chewing.</p><p>Prevalence estimates have been \u201cage-standardized\u201d to make them comparable across all countries no matter the demographic profile of the country. This is done by applying each country\u2019s age-and-sex specific prevalence rates to the WHO Standard Population. The resulting rates are hypothetical numbers which are only meaningful when comparing rates obtained for one country</p><p>with those obtained for another country.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Raw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used to calculate comparable estimates for this indicator. Information from subnational surveys are not used. </p><p>While less than 1 in 5 countries are currently reporting on all types of tobacco use, three-quarters of countries have robust data on tobacco smoking. Until the majority of countries are reporting on all types of tobacco use (smoked and smokeless), this indicator will be populated with tobacco smoking rates. In some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries, smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree. </p><p>The comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the estimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age ranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different tobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country\u2019s perception of which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored simultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of e-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries\u2019 definitions of tobacco use. The definition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, surveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use. </p><p>There is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use. WHO\u2019s Tobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve comparability of indicators across countries.</p>",

A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN sub-region. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year.

Limitations of the indicator:  Improved methods, enhanced data and improved estimation tools are enabling a better understanding of the degrees of uncertainty that surround HIV estimates. This is part of an ongoing process of improving estimates and developing appropriate ranges\u2014all of which are vital for effective HIV planning and programming at national and regional levels. Because the quality of data varies from country to country, the ranges of uncertainty surrounding estimates can widen or narrow depending on the country. The ranges reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with estimates and define the boundaries within which the actual numbers lie. Four factors determine the extent of the ranges around the HIV estimates: (i) The HIV prevalence level \u2013 Ranges tend to be smaller when HIV prevalence is higher.  (ii) The quality of the data \u2013 Countries with better quality data have smaller ranges than countries with poorer quality data. The ranges for Asia and the Pacific are comparatively broad\u2014which reflects the fact that HIV surveillance of key populations (such as injecting drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men) is relatively poor in some countries in that region, hence resulting in more uncertainty. In general, the ranges for sub-Saharan Africa are narrower, because of recent improvements in the collection and interpretation of HIV data in that region (including the availability of a national survey for most countries). (iii) The number of steps or assumptions used to arrive at an estimate \u2013 The more steps and assumptions, the wider the uncertainty range is likely to be (since each step introduces additional uncertainties). For example, ranges around estimates of adult HIV prevalence are smaller than those around estimates of HIV incidence among children, which require additional data on the probability of mother-to-child HIV transmission. The latter are based on prevalence among pregnant women, the probability of mother-to-child HIV transmission, and estimated survival times for HIV-positive children. There is therefore greater uncertainty in these estimates than for adult prevalence alone. (iv) The type of epidemic (generalized or low-level/concentrated)\u2013 Ranges tend to be wider in countries with low-level or concentrated epidemics than in countries with generalized epidemics because in low-level or concentrated epidemics, one needs to estimate both the numbers of people in the groups at higher risk of HIV infection and HIV prevalence rates. Assumptions, methodologies and data used to produce the estimates are gradually changing as a result of ongoing enhancement in our knowledge of the epidemic; hence most recent estimates should not be compared with those published in previous years. HIstorical HIV estimates are updated annually during each round of estimation exercises.",

At the world level, females have a life expectancy of 21.1 years in 2005-2010, compared to 18.2 years for males. The female advantage is considerably larger in the more developed regions (4.0 years) than in the less developed regions (2.3 years). The gap between male and female life expectancy is particularly narrow in the least developed countries (1.1 years). The indicator reflects possible gender differences in determinants of health and mortality at ages above 60, including prevalence of smoking, obesity, limited physical activity or ability of older women and men to access health care, among others. There are significant gender differences in the causes of deaths above age 60. Life expectancy at age 60 is an outcome indicator and to understand gender differences in health and mortality in this age group more detailed study of gender differences needs to be carried.",

                        "METADATA_DESCRIPTION": "In developed countries, mortality rates at ages above 60 can be measured using data from civil registration systems and population estimates derived from censuses or population registers. In most developing countries, however, the estimation of mortality rates above age 60 is seriously constrained by the absence of reliable, continuous, and complete data registration systems. Throughout many countries where such systems are not in place, valid measures of mortality above age 60 are not available. Other sources of information have to be incorporated, such as estimates of adult mortality below age 60 and/or child mortality estimates, which are then applied to a model life table age pattern of mortality to derive estimates of mortality rates above age 60.  Empirical observations on deaths by age and sex and age- and sex-specific mortality estimates are taken from various sources: a) For countries with death registration systems, data on deaths by age and sex are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC). Other sources, such as data reported on the national statistics website and mortality estimates from the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org) or research publications are also used. (b) For survey data, the information for calculation of adult mortality estimates below age 60 or 50 can be obtained from surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), MICS and other nationally sponsored surveys. To derive estimates for adult mortality after age 60, model life table age pattern need to be employed. (c) For census data, the data on deaths by age and sex in the last 12 or 24 months are obtained from census reports. Estimates of age-specific mortality rates from the census data are calculated by the Population Division or are obtained from census reports and research publications.

This indicator is calculated using life table methods (see further details in section 3.3).</p>  Rationale: <p>Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs in a population.</p>  Concepts: <p>Probability of dying: The likelihood that an individual would die between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a mortality rate.</p><p>Life table: A table showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to a set of age-specific mortality rates.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases: ICD-10 underlying causes of death I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes and some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions reinforce the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some information on causes of death in populations without well-functioning death registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death.</p>",

In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.</p><p>The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below.

The three top causes of death for adult women are infectious and parasitic diseases; cancers; and cardiovascular diseases. The three top causes of death for adult men are injuries; cardiovascular diseases and infectious and parasitic diseases. Adult men have higher mortality rates than adult women for all these causes of death with the exception of cancers where male and female rates are similar. Across regions and countries there are variations in the ranking of the causes of death and the gender gap in adult mortality due to specific causes of death. For example in Africa the number one cause of death for both women and men is HIV/AIDS and women have a higher adult mortality rate from this cause than men. The second most prevalent cause of death is other infectious and parasitic diseases where adult men have a higher mortality rate than adult women. The third cause of death is injuries for men and maternal and nutritional conditions for women. As another example in low and middle income countries of the Americas the leading cause of death for adult women is cancers from which they have a higher mortality rate than men. For adult men the number 1 cause of death is injuries from which their rate of mortality is several times higher than women\u2019s. (WHO 2011.

Different constraints may come into play: women parliamentarians may find that they do not have the support of their peers or that the gender-based policies they advocate are at odds with the policies of the political parties they represent. Numbers do matter however, and women\u2019s increased presence in parliament does, at a minimum, facilitate the articulation of women\u2019s concerns and alter the gender dynamics in parliament. The role of women parliamentarians needs to be considered alongside other actors such as the executive and in the government, the national gender machinery and women\u2019s groups in civil society.  The involvement of women in setting political priorities delivers a stronger and more representative democracy and results in better outcomes for citizens. While parliaments vary in terms of the number of women members, it is apparent that the efforts of women have resulted in more gender policies that are of benefit to them and the communities in which they are based. Women parliamentarians are the most ardent promoters and defenders of women and have redefined political priorities to include gender issues. But the role does not fall exclusively to women and more needs to be done to forge a partnership between men and women. How men can further support gender issues requires further attention.",

With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection.

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day what activity followed and the time that activity began and ended and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period such as a day or week. Often stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. (b) Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. (c) Time-use data presented refer to the \u201cmain activity\u201d only. Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. (d) The different age groups presented by countries for their data also makes time use data incomparable across countries.",

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day what activity followed and the time that activity began and ended and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period such as a day or week. Often stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. (b) Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. (c) Time-use data presented refer to the \u201cmain activity\u201d only. Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. (d) The different age groups presented by countries for their data also makes time use data incomparable across countries.",

In societies that sanction male dominance over women, violence between intimate partners may be perceived as an ordinary component of interpersonal dynamics between the sexes, particularly in the context of marriage or other formal unions. Therefore, it represents one manifestation of gender inequality.</p><p>Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk; explore the barriers to seeking help; and ensure that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies, and developing effective responses and programmes, as needed. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and assess the effectiveness of their interventions.</p>  Concepts: <p>According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), Violence against Women is \u201cAny act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family [\u2026]\u201d. See here for full definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm </p><p>Intimate partner violence includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union.</p><p>The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: </p><p>1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. </p><p>2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.</p><p>3. Psychological violence includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners and are acts of violence in themselves.</p><p>For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p><p>For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p><p>For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Comparability:</p><p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, used different definitions of partner or spousal violence and of the different forms of violence and different survey question formulations, and diverse age groups are often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p><p>Regularity of data production:</p><p>Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women. Obtaining data on violence against women is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available.</p>",

Evidence has shown that globally, an estimated 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner at some point in their lives (WHO et al., 2013). Having data on this indicator will help understand the extent and nature of this form of violence and develop appropriate policies and programmes.</p>  Concepts: <p>According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), Violence against Women is \u201cAny act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: [\u2026], Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution [\u2026]\u201d. See here for full definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm</p><p>Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. However, in most surveys that collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the information collected is limited to forcing someone into sexual intercourse when she does not want to, as well as attempting to force someone to perform a sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual intercourse. </p><p>For a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p><p>For a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p><p>For a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Comparability:</p><p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies and used different definitions of sexual violence and different survey question formulation. Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p><p>Efforts and investment will be required to develop an internationally-agreed standard and definition of sexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries.</p><p>Regularity of data production:</p><p>Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women and girls. Obtaining data on violence against women and girls is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other surveys. Not all VAW surveys, however, collect information on non-intimate partner violence. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available.</p>",

On a broader scale violence against women interferes with the social economic and political development of societies.The experience of violence can affect women in a myriad of ways. Injuries and health problems are common as a result of physical and sexual violence but the psychological and emotional wounds they may also inflict are sometimes deeper and longer lasting. Violence can lead to a reduced ability of a woman to work care for her family and contribute to society. Witnessing violence in childhood can also result in a range of behavioural and emotional problems.Violence against women also incurs significant economic costs both direct and indirect. Direct costs include those associated with the police hospital and other health services legal costs and costs associated with housing social and support services. Indirect costs include those related to reduced employment and productivity and the diminished value of a life lived with violence.",

Once reviewed, feedback is made available on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. New data points that are accepted are then entered into UNICEF\u2019s global databases and published in the State of the World\u2019s Children statistical tables, as well as in all other data-driven publications/material. The updated databases are also posted online at data.unicef.org.</p><p>UNICEF also searches throughout the year for additional sources of data that are vetted by the UNICEF country office before they are included in the global databases.</p>",

There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman\u2019s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socio-economic improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services.</p>  Concepts: <p>The adolescent birth rate represents the risk of childbearing among females in the particular age group. The adolescent birth rate among women aged 15-19 years is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19.</p>  Comments and limitations: <p>Discrepancies between the sources of data at the country level are common and the level of the adolescent birth rate depends in part on the source of the data selected. </p><p>For civil registration, rates are subject to limitations which depend on the completeness of birth registration, the treatment of infants born alive but die before registration or within the first 24 hours of life, the quality of the reported information relating to age of the mother, and the inclusion of births from previous periods. The population estimates may suffer from limitations connected to age misreporting and coverage.</p><p>For survey and census data, both the numerator and denominator come from the same population. The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling variability in the case of surveys.</p><p>With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20\u201324 years. </p><p>The adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates. It has also been called adolescent fertility rate. A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19.</p>",

The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and census data.</p><p>In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.</p><p>In the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.</p><p>With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census.</p><p>If data are available, adolescent fertility at ages 10-14 years can also be computed. </p><p>For a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see Handbook on the Collection of Fertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11, (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_92E.pdf).

Census and household survey are alternate sources when there is no reliable civil registration.</p><p>Data on births by age of mother are obtained from civil registration systems covering 90 per cent or more of all live births, supplemented eventually by census or survey estimates for periods when registration data are not available. For the numerator, the figures reported by National Statistical Offices to the United Nations Statistics Division have first priority. When they are not available or present problems, use is made of data from the regional statistical units or directly from National Statistical Offices. For the denominator, first priority is given to the latest revision of World Population Prospects produced by the Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations. In cases where the numerator does not cover the complete de facto population, an alternative appropriate population estimate is used if available. When either the numerator or denominator is missing, the direct estimate of the rate produced by the National Statistics Office is used. Information on sources is provided at the cell level. When the numerator and denominator come from two different sources, they are listed in that order.</p><p>In countries lacking a civil registration system or where the coverage of that system is lower than 90 per cent of all live births, the adolescent birth rate is obtained from household survey data and census data. Registration data regarded as less than 90 per cent complete are exceptionally used for countries where the alternative sources present problems of compatibility and registration data can provide an assessment of trends. In countries with multiple survey programmes, large sample surveys conducted on an annual or biennial basis are given precedence when they exist.</p><p>For information on the source of each estimate, see United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2015). World Fertility Data 2015 (POP/DB/Fert/Rev2015). http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/fertility/wfd2015.shtml</p>  Collection process: <p>For civil registration data, data on births or the adolescent birth rate are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC). The population figures are obtained from the last revision of the United Nations Population Division World Population Prospects and only exceptionally from other sources.</p><p>Survey data are obtained from national household surveys that are internationally coordinated\u2014such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)\u2014and other nationally-sponsored surveys. Other national surveys conducted as part of the European Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) or the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM) may be considered as well. The data are taken from published survey reports or, in exceptional cases, other published analytical reports. Whenever the estimates are available in the survey report, they are directly taken from it. If clarification is needed, contact is made with the survey sponsors or authoring organization, which occasionally may supply corrected or adjusted estimates in response. In other cases, if microdata are available, estimates are produced by the Population Division based on national data.</p><p>For census data, the estimates are preferably directly obtained from census reports. In such cases, adjusted rates are only used when reported by the National Statistical Office. In other cases, the adolescent birth rate is computed from tables on births in the preceding 12 months by age of mother, and census population distribution by sex and age. </p><p>In addition to obtaining data and estimates directly from the websites of National Statistical Offices, the following databases and websites are utilized: the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) (http://api.dhsprogram.com/#/index.html), Demographic Yearbook database of the Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (http://data.un.org), internal databases of the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (see latest public release here: http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/fertility/wfd2015.shtml), Eurostat (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), the Human Fertility Database (http://www.humanfertility.org), the Human Fertility Collection (http://www.fertilitydata.org), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (http://mics.unicef.org/).

The possibility of being able to work for fewer hours is also seen as a means to increase employment levels, particularly among women. In addition, part-time work facilitates the gradual entry into, participation in and exit from the labour market. Women are more likely than men to be engaged in part-time employment. However, part-time work also comes at a cost. Part-time workers face difficult working conditions, including lower hourly wages and lesser job security, and receive less training and promotion opportunities than their full-time counterparts. They are also at a higher risk of falling into poverty and are less likely to have access to social protection such as unemployment benefits. Some forms of part-time work in developed countries are non-standard types of work with employment conditions similar to those described for informal employment.

Women are more likely than men to work mainly at home; women are more likely than men to work at home in manual activities. Homeworkers face many common challenges, as well as challenges that differ according to their employment status. Because of their Homeworkers are largely invisible and in isolation, most are unorganized and therefore are not able to bargain with their employers (or intermediaries) for wages, with local authorities for infrastructure and services, or about prices with suppliers. On average they earn very little, especially those working on a piece rate system. Homeworkers are dependent on contractors and intermediaries for orders and for payment. Orders are often irregular and their payments slow to come. Homeworkers generally have little or no protection through labour law or social protection measures. Even where they are producing on order from a business, and should be entitled to conditions equal to those of other workers in the industry, often their real employer is unknown to them and they generally remain without worker benefits and protections.  As the home is the workplace for home-based workers, inadequate housing and poor services affect their ability to work productively and also affect members of the family. Another challenging issue is health and safety. Homeworkers are exposed to many hazards: some are exposed to dangerous chemicals, others develop posture problems and so on.

Domestic violence \u2018includes a range of sexually, psychologically and physically coercive acts used against adult and adolescent women by a current or former intimate partner, without her consent\u2019 (UN General Assembly 2006, 37). The data refer to instances where domestic, family or intimate partner violence is specifically criminalized or where provisions for protection orders are in place.  Sexual harassment is defined as: \u2018Unwelcome sexually determined behaviour, in both horizontal and vertical relationships, including in employment (including the informal employment sector), education, receipt of goods and services, sporting activities, and property transactions\u2019 (UN DESA-DAW 2009a, 28). The data refer to whether countries have laws in place that prohibit sexual harassment under civil or criminal law, specifically in relation to employment. Voluntary guidelines or policies are not counted. Marital rape, also called spousal rape, is non-consensual sex where the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. Although general rape laws (except where exemption of a spouse is explicitly stated) do not preclude a spouse from being prosecuted, the data refer to instances where the law explicitly criminalizes marital rape, without qualifications, for example by \u2018providing that sexual assault provisions apply \u201cirrespective of the nature of the relationship\u201d between the perpetrator and complainant; or \u2018stating that \u201cno marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defence to a charge of sexual assault under the legislation\u201d\u2019(UN DESA-DAW 2009a, 26). In other instances, a marital (or equivalent) relationship may be explicitly cited in the law as an aggravating factor. Explicit criminalization of marital rape is recommended as best practice by, among others, the Council of Europe (Council of Europe 2009c).",
