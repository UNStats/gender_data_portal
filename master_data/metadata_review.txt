This indicator is defined as the average number of hours spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”. 

  Concepts: 

_Unpaid domestic and care work _refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”.

1.   Own-use production work (activities to produce goods and services for own final use; the intended destination of the output is mainly for final use of the producer in the form of capital formation, or final consumption by household members or by family members living in other households; in the case of agricultural, fishing, hunting or gathering goods intended mainly for own consumption, a part or surplus may nevertheless be sold or bartered)

The own-use production work can be differentiated based on whether goods or services are produced.

_This indicator only considers the own-use production work of services, or in other words, the activities related to unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services undertaken by households for their own use. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”._

As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017.

  Comments and limitations: 

Time use statistics have been used for: (1) provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of individuals and households; (2) offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; (3) produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.

International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: 

1.   Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. 
2.   Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. 
3.   Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. 
4.   Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.

1	72	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

Data presented for this indicator are expressed as the average number of hours spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work. Weekly data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. 

Average number of hours spent in a day on relevant activities = 

(Total number of hours spent by the population on relevant activities)/(Total population (regardless of whether they participated in the activity))

Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. 

_This indicator is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. _

  Quality assurance 

UNSD has been reviewing in detail the survey methodology followed to collect time use data and the classification of activities used by countries, to assess the level of comparability across countries and over time in a given country. 

__Consultation/validation process with countries for adjustments and estimates__

Most of the data are provided and validated by national statistical offices. In some cases, data have been obtained from publicly available national databases and publications. UNSD communicates with countries if there are inconsistencies or possible errors in the data."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level.

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey.

With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. 
2.   Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. 
3.   Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. 
4.   Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.

1	87	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

Data presented for this indicator are expressed as the average number of hours spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work. Weekly data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. 

Average number of hours spent in a day on relevant activities = 

(Total number of hours spent by the population on relevant activities)/(Total population (regardless of whether they participated in the activity))

Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. 

_This indicator is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. _

1	88	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

This indicator is defined as the average number of hours spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”. 

  Concepts: 

_Unpaid domestic and care work _refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”.

Concepts and definitions for this indicator are based on the following international standards:

*   System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008)
*   The Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) at its 19th Session in 2013

Relevant specific concepts are presented below:

*   An activity is said to be productive or to fall within the “general production boundary” if it satisfies the third-person criterion (the activity can be delegated to another person and yield the same desired results).
*   Productive activities can be further classified based on the ILO framework for work statistics (included in the 19<sup>th</sup> ICLS resolution) into:

1.   Own-use production work (activities to produce goods and services for own final use; the intended destination of the output is mainly for final use of the producer in the form of capital formation, or final consumption by household members or by family members living in other households; in the case of agricultural, fishing, hunting or gathering goods intended mainly for own consumption, a part or surplus may nevertheless be sold or bartered)
2.   Employment (activities to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit)
3.   Unpaid trainee work (any unpaid activity to produce goods or provide services for others, in order to acquire workplace experience or skills in a trade or profession)
4.   Volunteer work (any unpaid, non-compulsory activity to produce goods or provide services for others)

The own-use production work can be differentiated based on whether goods or services are produced.

_This indicator only considers the own-use production work of services, or in other words, the activities related to unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services undertaken by households for their own use. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”._

As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017.

  Comments and limitations: 

Time use statistics have been used for: (1) provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of individuals and households; (2) offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; (3) produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.

International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: 

1.   Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. 
2.   Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. 
3.   Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. 
4.   Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.

  Quality assurance 

UNSD has been reviewing in detail the survey methodology followed to collect time use data and the classification of activities used by countries, to assess the level of comparability across countries and over time in a given country. 

__Consultation/validation process with countries for adjustments and estimates__

Most of the data are provided and validated by national statistical offices. In some cases, data have been obtained from publicly available national databases and publications. UNSD communicates with countries if there are inconsistencies or possible errors in the data."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
1	88	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Time use statistics have been used for: (a) the measurement and analysis of quality of life or general well-being; (b) a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work including unpaid and volunteer work; and (c) for the improvement of estimates on the production of goods and services with particular emphasis on increasing visibility of women’s work through better statistics on their contribution to the economy and the development of satellite accounts.International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors including: (a) diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day what activity followed and the time that activity began and ended and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period such as a day or week. Often stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. (b) Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. (c) Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. (d) The different age groups presented by countries for their data also makes time use data incomparable across countries.	Agency

1	88	6	Process of obtaining data	"Description: 

Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level.

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection.

  Collection process: 

The official counterparts at the country level are the national statistical offices. Data are compiled and validated. If there are inconsistencies or issues with the data, UNSD consults the focal point in the national statistical office. The data for this indicator are, as much as possible, in line with relevant international standards, or properly footnoted. International standards include:

2	73	2	International agreed definition	This indicator provides data for the total work burden of women and men (paid and unpaid). Paid work corresponds to the SNA production boundary and refers to work related activities in formal employment or informal employment, production of goods by households for income or for own final use, paid construction activities and construction for own capital formation and provision of services for income. those refers to work refers to the average time women and men spend on household provision of services for own consumption.  Unpaid work includes both the unpaid domestic work as well as on community or volunteer work. Domestic work includes food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of a dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household members, among others. Community or volunteer work includes volunteer services for organizations, unpaid community work, and informal help to other households, among other activities. Unpaid work are not included within the SNA production boundary but are inside the SNA General Production Boundary. As much as possible, data compiled here has been based on the trial International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics (ICATUS), according to which paid and unpaid work are delineated by the SNA production boundary.	Agency
2	73	3	Method of computation	Average number of hours spent on total work, paid and unpaid, derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants only or (2) average time spent for all population of certain age. In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. All statistics presented in the Minimum Set on Gender Indicators on time spent in various activities are averages based on all total relevant population. This type of averages can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both.  Data presented for this indicator are expressed as an average per day. It is averaged over seven days of the week (weekdays and weekends are not differentiated). Thus, for paid work, a five-day work week averaging seven hours per day would show up as an average of five hours of paid work per day (35 hours divided by 7 days).	Agency
2	73	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Time-use data in general can reveal the details of an individual’s “daily life with a combination of specificity and comprehensiveness”. Time spent on domestic/unpaid work assesses intra-household allocation of time. It can help analysis study the nature and extent of intra-household inequality and the impact of that inequality. Having information about the way time is allocated among the various members of a household helps policy makers understand which household members will be most directly affected by a policy modification.  International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: (a) diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. (b) Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. (c) Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity.

3	1	2	International agreed definition	The labour force participation rate is calculated as the labour force during a given reference period expressed as a percent of the working-age population in the same reference period. The labour force (formerly known as currently active population) comprises all persons of working age who furnish the supply of labour for the production of goods and services (as defined by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary) during a specified time-reference period. It is measured in relation to a short reference period such as one week or one day. It refers to the sum of all persons of working age who are employed and those who are unemployed. For more detailed information, please refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 2013): http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm	Agency
3	1	3	Method of computation	The labour force participation rate is calculated by expressing the number of persons in the labour force during a given reference period as a percentage of the working-age population in the same reference period. The labour force is the sum of the number of persons employed and the number of unemployed. The working-age population is the population above a certain age – ideally aged 15 and older – prescribed for the measurement of economic characteristics.	Agency
3	1	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	The indicator for labour force participation rate plays a central role in the study of the factors that determine the size and composition of a country’s human resources and in making projections of the future supply of labour. To some degree, the way in which the labour force is measured can have an effect on the extent to which men and women are included in labour force estimates. Unless specific probes are built into the data collection instrument, certain groups of workers may be underestimated – particularly the number of employed persons who (a) work for only a few hours in the reference period, especially if they do not do so regularly, (b) are in unpaid employment, or (c) work near or in their home, thus mixing work and personal activities during the day. Since women, more so than men, are found in these situations, it is to be expected that the number of women in employment (and thus the female labour force) will tend to be underestimated to a larger extent than the number of men.

3	1	6	Process of obtaining data	Household labour force surveys are generally the most comprehensive and comparable sources for labour force statistics. Other possible sources include population censuses and official estimates. The ILO has made an intensive effort to assemble data on the indicators for as many countries, areas and territories as possible. Where there is no information for a country, it is usually because the country involved was not in a position to provide information for the indicator. Even when information for an indicator was available, it may not have been sufficiently current or may not have met other qualifications established for inclusion in the Key Indicators of the Labour Market, on which the information for participation rates is based. In compiling the KILM, the ILO concentrates on bringing together information from international repositories. In other words, the KILM team rarely collects information directly from national sources, but rather takes advantage of existing compilations held by various organizations, such as the following: International Labour Office (Department of Statistics ILOSTAT database), United Nations Statistics Division, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information maintained by these organizations has generally been obtained from national sources or is based on official national publications. Whenever information was available from more than one repository, the information and background documentation from each repository was reviewed in order to select the information most suitable for inclusion, based on an assessment of the general reliability of the sources, the availability of methodological information and explanatory notes regarding the scope of coverage, the availability of information by sex and age, and the degree of historical coverage. Occasionally, two data repositories have been chosen and presented for a single country, any resulting breaks in the historical series are duly noted. For countries with less-developed labour market information systems, such as those in some developing economies, information may not be easily available to policy-makers and the social partners, and even less so to international organizations seeking to compile global data sets. Many of these countries, however, do collect labour market information through household and establishment surveys, population censuses and administrative records, so that the main problem remains the communication of such information to the global community. In this situation, the ILO Labour Market Indicators Library (LMIL) programme can help. The LMIL is a system for sharing information between the ILO regional offices and headquarters. ILO regional offices are closer to the original micro-sources of data and have therefore been successful in filling in numerous gaps where data at headquarters – used in the production of the KILM – had not existed. It is an ongoing programme that continues to assist the KILM and other ILO publications and research programmes in the expansion of its country and yearly coverage of indicators.

The employed comprise all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: a) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work), or b) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). The concept at work refers to persons who during the reference period performed some work for wage or salary, in cash or in kind (for paid employment), or persons who during the reference period performed some work for profit or family gain, in cash or in kind (for self-employment).

This indicator presents the share of non-agricultural employment which is classified as informal employment.

  Rationale: 

Informal employment offers a necessary survival strategy in countries that lack social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, or where wages and pensions are low, especially in the public sector. In these situations, indicators such as the unemployment rate and time-related underemployment are not sufficient to describe the labour market completely. Statistics on the informal economy are key to assessing the quality of employment in an economy, and are relevant to developing and developed countries alike (ILOSTAT indicator description for informality, available at [http://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/description\_IFL\_EN.pdf](http://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/description_IFL_EN.pdf)).

  Concepts: 

Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were either in paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work) or in self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). 

Informal employment comprises persons who in their main or secondary jobs were in one of the following categories:

*   Own-account workers, employers and members of producers’ cooperatives employed in their own informal sector enterprises (the characteristics of the enterprise determine the informal nature of their jobs);
*   Own-account workers engaged in the production of goods exclusively for own final use by their household (e.g. subsistence farming);
*   Contributing family workers, regardless of whether they work in formal or informal sector enterprises (they usually do not have explicit, written contracts of employment, and are not subject to labour legislation, social security regulations, collective agreements, etc., which determines the informal nature of their jobs);
*   Employees holding informal jobs, whether employed by formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or as paid domestic workers by households (employees are considered to have informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice, not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment benefits). 

*   Own-account workers, employers and members of producers’ cooperatives employed in their own informal sector enterprises (the characteristics of the enterprise determine the informal nature of their jobs);

An enterprise belongs to the informal sector if it fulfils the three following conditions: 

*   It is an unincorporated enterprise (it is not constituted as a legal entity separate from its owners, and it is owned and controlled by one or more members of one or more households, and it is not a quasi-corporation: it does not have a complete set of accounts, including balance sheets); 
*   It is a market enterprise (it sells at least some of the goods or services it produces); 
*   The enterprise is not registered or the employees of the enterprise are not registered or the number of persons engaged on a continuous basis is below a threshold determined by the country.

*   It is an unincorporated enterprise (it is not constituted as a legal entity separate from its owners, and it is owned and controlled by one or more members of one or more households, and it is not a quasi-corporation: it does not have a complete set of accounts, including balance sheets);

  Comments and limitations: 

The considerable heterogeneity of definitions and operational criteria used by countries to measure informal employment greatly hinders the international comparability of statistics on informality. 

Also, the scope of this indicator is limited to non-agriculture. However, to have a comprehensive picture of the importance of informality in the economy and to better understand its patterns, statistics on informal employment should be produced and analysed for both agricultural and non-agricultural activities."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

  Quality assurance 

With a view to ensuring data quality and reliability, and especially cross-country comparability, the ILO derives statistics on informal employment based on a standard definition and standard operational criteria through processing microdata sets from household surveys.

Thanks to this exercise, two series of indicators on informality are disseminated in the ILO’s central statistical database, ILOSTAT ([www.ilo.org/ilostat](http://www.ilo.org/ilostat)): one referring to the statistics produced and reported by countries, and another based on ILO’s standard criteria (harmonized).

9	74	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Statistics on informal employment are essential to obtaining a clear idea of the contributions of all workers, women in particular, to the economy. Indeed, the informal economy has been considered as “the fallback position for women who are excluded from paid employment. [...] The dominant aspect of the informal economy is selfemployment. It is an important source of livelihood for women in the developing world, especially in those areas where cultural norms bar them from work outside the home or where, because of conflict with household responsibilities, they cannot undertake regular employee working hours” (United Nations: Handbook for Producing National Statistical Reports on Women and Men, Social Statistics and Indicators, Series K, No. 14 (New York, 1997), p. 232).

10	9	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed.

  Rationale: 

The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can

be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.

  Concepts: 

Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age (usually persons aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) “not in employment” is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to “seek employment” refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise’s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d) “currently available” serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups).

Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually persons aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. They comprise: (a) employed persons “at work”, i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour; (b) employed persons “not at work” due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements (such as shift work, flexitime and compensatory leave for overtime)

The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment.

Even though in most developed countries the unemployment rate continues to prove its usefulness as an important indicator of labour market performance, and specifically, as a key measure of labourunderutilization, in many developing countries, however, the significance and meaning of the unemployment rate could be questioned. In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess labour underutilization."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

Unemployment rate = Unemployed persons / Persons in the labour force \*100"	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
10	9	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Information on youth unemployment illustrates the different dimensions of the lack of jobs for young people. In a country where the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one it may be concluded that the problem of unemployment is not specific to youth but is country-wide. When both indicators are high young people suffer more difficulties in finding a job than adults. The problem of unemployment is unequally distributed when in addition to a high youth unemployment rate the proportion of youth unemployment in total unemployment is high. In this case employment policies might usefully be directed towards easing the entry of young people into the world of work. Information on youth unemployment by sex shows the difficulty to enter the labour market by gender revealing in some cases a harder situation for women which is directly linked to a country''s social and cultural aspects and traditions.

The percentage of adults (ages 15+) who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution or personally using a mobile money service in the past 12 months. 

  Rationale: 

Access to formal financial services such as savings, insurance, payments, credit and remittances is essential to the ability of people—regardless of income level, gender, age, education or where they live—to manage their lives, build their futures, and grow their businesses. Having access to an account is an important starting point for people to access arange of financial services.

  Concepts: 

Account at a financial institution includes respondents who report having an account at a bank or at another type of financial institution, such as a credit union, microfinance institution, cooperative, or the post office (if applicable), or having a debit card in their own name. In addition, it includes respondents who report receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products into an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; paying utility bills or school fees from an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; or receiving wages or government transfers into a card in the past 12 months. Mobile money account includes respondents who report personally using GSM Association (GSMA) Mobile Money for the Unbanked (MMU) services in the past 12 months to pay bills or to send or receive money. In addition, it includes respondents who report receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products through a mobile phone in the past 12 months.

13	82	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

This indicator provides information on the mean hourly earnings from paid employment of employees by sex, occupation, age and disability status. 

  Rationale: 

Earnings are a key aspect of quality of employment and living conditions. Information on hourly earnings disaggregated by various classifications (sex, age, occupation, disability status) provides some indication of the extent to which pay equality is respected or achieved. 

  Concepts: 

Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers’ contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. 

For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees’ gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. 

As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees.

  Comments and limitations: 

The variety of possible sources for statistics on earnings greatly hinders international comparability, as each type of source has its own coverage, scope and characteristics. It would not be fully accurate to compare, for example, hourly earnings from a labour force survey for one country with hourly earnings from an establishment survey for another. 

The use of non-standard definitions and the heterogeneity of operational criteria applied further hamper cross-country comparisons. "	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
13	82	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

Statistics on average hourly earnings by sex can be used to calculate the gender pay gap, as follows:

13	82	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Differences in pay for men and women may result from a multitude of factors. They include individual characteristics of workers, such as their level and field of education and work experience, as well as factors connected to the job they perform, such as occupation, type of contract, economic sector and size of the establishment in which they work. Gender inequalities in all these areas are associated with traditions and stereotypes (influencing the choice of education, professions and career paths of women and men) and the difficulties in balancing work and family life that often lead to part-time work and career breaks, mainly for women.

However, the scope of this statistics is limited to the coverage of the establishment survey in question (usually excluding small establishments, agricultural establishments and/or informal sector establishments).

Household surveys (and especially labour force surveys) can provide earnings statistics covering all economic activities, and all establishment types and sizes, but the quality of the data is highly dependent on the accuracy of respondents’ answers.

Data on earnings could also be derived from a variety of administrative records."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

14	10	2	International agreed definition	"The youth unemployment rate is the proportion of the youth labour force that is unemployed. Young people are defined as persons aged between 15 and 24. The unemployed comprise all persons of working age who were: a) without work during the reference period, i.e. were not in paid employment or self-employment, b) currently available for work, i.e. were available for paid employment or self-employment during the reference period, and c) seeking work, i.e. had taken specific steps in a specified recent period to seek paid employment or self-employment. For purposes of international comparability, the period of job search is often defined as the preceding four weeks, but this varies from country to country. The specific steps taken to seek employment may include registration at a public or private employment exchange, application to employers, checking at worksites, farms, factory gates, market or other assembly places, placing or answering newspaper advertisements, seeking assistance of friends or relatives, looking for land, building, machinery or equipment to establish own enterprise, arranging for financial resources, and applying for permits and licences. Although the 13th ICLS recommendations allowed in some cases to apply a relaxed definition of unemployment, the resolution adopted by the 19th ICLS defines persons who were not in employment, were currently available and wanted employment but did not carry out activities to seek employment as ""available potential jobseekers"" within the potential labour force. Thus, for the purpose of international comparability the strict definition of unemployment should be applied (i.e., people who met all three criteria during the reference period). For more detailed information, please refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 2013): http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm"	Agency
14	10	3	Method of computation	The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the total number of youth unemployed (for a country or a specific group of workers) during the reference period by the corresponding labour force (in this case age group 15-24), which itself is the sum of the total persons employed and unemployed in the group.	Agency
14	10	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Information on youth unemployment illustrates the different dimensions of the lack of jobs for young people. In a country where the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one, it may be concluded that the problem of unemployment is not specific to youth, but is country-wide. When both indicators are high, young people suffer more difficulties in finding a job than adults. The problem of unemployment is unequally distributed when, in addition to a high youth unemployment rate, the proportion of youth unemployment in total unemployment is high. In this case, employment policies might usefully be directed towards easing the entry of young people into the world of work.

14	10	6	Process of obtaining data	Household labour force surveys are generally the most comprehensive and comparable sources for employment statistics. Other possible sources include population censuses, official estimates and administrative records such as employment office records and social insurance statistics. The ILO has made an intensive effort to assemble data on the indicators for as many countries, areas and territories as possible. Where there is no information for a country, it is usually because the country involved was not in a position to provide information for the indicator. Even when information for an indicator was available, it may not have been sufficiently current or may not have met other qualifications established for inclusion in the Key Indicators of the Labour Market, on which the information for youth unemployment is based. In compiling the KILM, the ILO concentrates on bringing together information from international repositories. In other words, the KILM team rarely collects information directly from national sources, but rather takes advantage of existing compilations held by various organizations, such as the following: International Labour Office (Department of Statistics ILOSTAT database), United Nations Statistics Division, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information maintained by these organizations has generally been obtained from national sources or is based on official national publications. Whenever information was available from more than one repository, the information and background documentation from each repository was reviewed in order to select the information most suitable for inclusion, based on an assessment of the general reliability of the sources, the availability of methodological information and explanatory notes regarding the scope of coverage, the availability of information by sex and age, and the degree of historical coverage. Occasionally, two data repositories have been chosen and presented for a single country, any resulting breaks in the historical series are duly noted. For countries with less-developed labour market information systems, such as those in the developing economies, information may not be easily available to policy-makers and the social partners, and even less so to international organizations seeking to compile global data sets. Many of these countries, however, do collect labour market information through household and establishment surveys, population censuses and administrative records, so that the main problem remains the communication of such information to the global community. In this situation, the ILO Labour Market Indicators Library (LMIL) programme can help. The LMIL is a system for sharing information between the ILO regional offices and headquarters. ILO regional offices are closer to the original micro-sources of data and have therefore been successful in filling in numerous gaps where data at headquarters – used in the production of the KILM – had not existed. It is an ongoing programme that continues to assist the KILM and other ILO publications and research programmes in the expansion of its country and yearly coverage of indicators. In principle, the data are not adjusted, as they are collected through a standard questionnaire, and reported in line with the international classifications. All departures from the international standard definitions and classifications are indicated in notes.	Agency

17	11	2	International agreed definition	This is the percentage of individuals using the Internet from any location. Until 2013 the reference period used for this indicator was the last 12 months. In 2013, the definition has been updated and the reference period is now the last three months. While some countries already used the narrower reference period in the past, most countries may still take some time to adhere to the new reference period. The Internet is a world-wide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer − it may also be by mobile-cellular telephone, other wireless devices, games machine, digital TV etc.).

17	11	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Internet use data disaggregated by sex is key in ensuring that realities of both men and women are reflected in gender-inclusive policies. Having access and making use of Internet allow citizens to benefit from the extensive amount of services, applications and information available on the Internet, which have the potential of empowering citizens. Women have a particular potential of benefiting from the use of Internet, since they can for example use it as a platform for entrepreneurship or self-employment, to do formal e-learning or to get information about health related issues or any general topic of interest, especially for those who due to home and family duties cannot travel to places where employment opportunities, face-to-face education or health care is available. However, this implies that women should be able to have access from home or from a nearby place, which is not the case for many of them in the developing world. Women can also take advantage of Internet to express their views on civil and political issues via websites (e.g. blogs, social networks, etc) or take part in on-line consultations or voting to define civic or political issues (e.g. urban planning, signing a petition).	Agency
17	11	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	Does not apply.	Agency
17	11	6	Process of obtaining data	Data on individuals using the Internet disaggregated by sex are collected through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices (NSO). In this questionnaire, ITU collects total estimates. Percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years’ data and situation of the country for other related indicators (ICT and economic). Data coming from surveys are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly comparable.	Agency
17	11	7	Treatment of missing values	No treatment is done for missing data disaggregated by sex as the indicator is calculated only in the year for which a suitable survey data are available. Data estimates at the country level can be sporadically produced by ITU for the purpose of estimating global aggregate figures but these are not released at the country level. The method used is hot-deck imputations, for example using nearest neighbor analysis. Estimates are done for the main indicator including both sexes, but not for each sex, that is, for the percentage of individuals using the Internet. ITU uses imputation methods that consider several other indicators such as the number of fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, active mobile broadband subscriptions, households with Internet and the income of the country.	Agency
17	11	8	Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity	Data on mobile telephone users disaggregated by sex is available for about 70 countries in the world but not for each year. Data availability depends very much on the availability of household surveys and the willing of National Statistics Office to include the indicator in their surveys. The methodology of surveys in which these data is collected is analized by ITU when the data and metadata is received. The survey methodology needs to have minimum quality standards (adequate sample design, acceptable standard error, small proportion of non-response or adequate non-response treatment, etc.) in order for ITU to integrate the results in the database.	Agency
17	11	9	Expected time of release	Data is released in December through the World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database. Data for the latest available year are also available at no cost through the ITU’s statistics page, see: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics. However, release of new data for a country will depend on availability of new household surveys including the related question.	Agency

18	12	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

The proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex is defined as the ‘proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex’. 

  Rationale: 

Mobile phone networks have spread rapidly over the last decade and the number of mobile-cellular subscriptions is quasi equal to the number of the people living on earth. However, not every person uses, or owns a mobile-cellular telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy, including for professional purposes. A number of studies have highlighted the link between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth.

Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that less women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the importance of mobile phone ownership to track and to improve gender equality, and monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender divide. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Task Group on Gender of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development.

  Concepts: 

An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included. Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded. Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that has been used in the last three months.

A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which provides access to the PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems and technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid subscriptions and prepaid accounts are included.

  Comments and limitations: 

While the data on the ‘proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone’ currently only exist for very few countries, ITU is encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national household surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development’s Core List of Indicators. The number of countries with official data for this indicator is expected to increase in the near future."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

18	12	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Mobile phone use by women has the potential to empower them by increasing economic and professional opportunities, especially for entrepreneurship or self-employment. A mobile phone could substitute for an office or even a bank account. However, one of the limitations of this indicator is that it refers to use of the device, regardless whether it is owned or not by the person, it can be for instance borrowed from the husband or the service bought in a public phone service. Having access through sharing or borrowing rather than owning often entails dependency relationships. Since an ownership indicator is not (yet) broadly collected, use of mobile phones remains a good source of information for policy making and certainly provides a better picture for tracking gender issues than, for instance, an indicator on mobile subscriptions.

This indicator is a newly developed ITU indicator that was approved by the World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Symposium (WTIS) 2014. The indicator’s definition and methodology were developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. Data for the proportion of individuals owning a mobile phone were first collected in 2015, through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices (NSO). In this questionnaire, through which ITU already collects a number of ICT indicators, ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years’ data and other relevant country-level indicators (ICT and economic).

Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly comparable.

20	13	2	International agreed definition	The percentage of the population aged 15–24 years who can both read and write with understanding a short simple statement on everyday life.	Agency
20	13	3	Method of computation	Literacy rates are computed by dividing the number of persons aged 15-24 years who are literate by the total population in the same age group. The result is then multiplied by 100 to yield the literacy rate in per cent.	Agency
20	13	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	The Youth Literacy Rate reflects the outcome of primary education over the previous decade. As a measure of the effectiveness of the education system, it is often seen as a proxy measure of social progress and economic achievement. Reasons for failing to achieve the literacy standard may include non-attendance, low quality of schooling or dropping out before completion of primary education. Differences in literacy levels between young women and men will often reflect recent inequalities in access to formal education and persisting inequalities in adult life and the world of work.	Agency
20	13	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	Literacy rates published by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) are based on national population censuses and household surveys. Discrepancies may arise when countries derive projected figures using methods that differ from those used by the UIS, or when countries derive literacy rates from data on educational attainment. Literacy is usually measured in population censuses and household surveys through self- or household declaration. Literacy can also be measured through a reading test or other assessment of literacy skills. The variety of measurement methods can cause difficulties for international comparisons. Comparability over time, even for the same survey, may also be a problem because definitions of literacy used in the surveys may not be standardised.	Agency
20	13	6	Process of obtaining data	The UIS collects global literacy data with its annual literacy survey. Countries and territories are asked to report population counts by literacy status (total, literate, illiterate and not specified), disaggregated by five-year age group, sex and location (urban or rural). The data are typically reported by national statistical offices or agencies with special responsibility for literacy or adult education.  Population censuses are the primary source of basic literacy data. These data are usually collected together with other population and household characteristics concerning an individual’s educational, demographic and socio-economic status. The literacy status is generally based on proxy-declaration (i.e. one person, usually the head of the household, indicates whether each member of the household is literate or not). The literacy definition may vary from one country to another.  National sample surveys are a second source of literacy data and involve the use of a literacy variable in a household or individual sample survey. These surveys are often designed to meet immediate data needs and do not always include systematic strategies for repeated data collection in future years and therefore they may not be a consistently reliable data source over time. International sample surveys, such as UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) or the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), are a third source and involve the use of a literacy variable in a household or individual sample survey. These surveys are designed to meet commonly agreed upon international data needs while also providing data for national policy purposes. These surveys are implemented on a regular basis in selected countries. They aim to assure cross-national comparability although they often integrate national modules to suit specific country data needs. Modules from international surveys are sometimes added to other on-going national sample surveys. The UIS conducts internal consistency checks in order to ensure the accuracy of the data provided. This is done by comparing literacy data for a country from different sources, across different years, and across countries in the same region.	Agency
20	13	7	Treatment of missing values	"The UIS publishes national literacy rates calculated from data provided by countries or territories to the UIS. Countries for which no observed literacy data are available are indicated as “data not available”. The UIS uses the Global Age-Specific Literacy Projections (GALP) model to produce estimates and forecasts of literacy/illiteracy rates for years without observed data. Further information on this methodology is available at the UIS website (www.uis.unesco.org). UNSD extracts this series directly via the UNESCO data portal using API. During the calculation of regional averages, imputation of literacy rates at the national level is used for countries without any observed data. In some cases, data for an individual country or territory have not been available for many years, yet to ignore the country in the calculation of a regional average may produce a figure that is not representative of the region. The UIS is engaged in ongoing efforts to improve its methodology in order to provide representative regional figures of the literacy rate. When counts of the population are reported as ""age unknown"" or ""literacy status not specified"", these data are removed during the processing of the questionnaire and not included in the calculation of literacy and illiteracy rates. When the counts of the population with unknown age or literacy status exceed a certain threshold (usually 10% of the total population), no literacy data are reported for the country. Research indicates that educational attainment is not a reliable predictor of literacy levels and the UIS does therefore not accept literacy data derived from data on educational attainment."	Agency
20	13	8	Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity	Youth literacy rates are available for around 130 countries.  Youth literacy rates change more quickly than adult literacy rates because they cover a smaller cohort and therefore need to be measured more often. Since population censuses normally occur only every 10 years, data from more frequently administered labour force and household surveys are used for annual estimates of the youth literacy rate. Household surveys are generally conducted every three to five years in most developing countries	Agency

21	14	2	International agreed definition	Net primary enrolment rate in primary education is the number of children of official primary school age (according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)) who are enrolled in primary education as a percentage of the total children of the official school age population. The adjusted net primary enrolment rate also includes children of primary school age enrolled in secondary education. Where more than one system of primary education exists within the country the most widespread or common structure is used for determining the official school age group.	Agency
21	14	3	Method of computation	To calculate the indicator one must first determine the population of official school age by reference to the theoretical starting age and duration of ISCED Level 1 (primary education) as reported by the country. Then, the number of pupils enrolled in primary (or secondary) education who are of the official primary school age is divided by the population for the same age-group and the result is multiplied by 100. This method requires information on the structure of education (i.e. theoretical entrance age and duration of ISCED Level 1), enrolment by single years of age and population of the age-group corresponding to the given level of education.	Agency
21	14	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Families may perceive the value of education differently for boys and girls. In situations of limited resources, girls are more likely to suffer from limited access to education, especially in rural areas. However, where basic education is widely available and overall enrolment is high, girls’ enrolment tends to be equal or higher than boys’ enrolment. In order to highlight and monitor these differences, it is important to disaggregate the indicator by sex. It is also important to consider disaggregation by geographical areas and social or ethnic groups and sex, since gender differences may be more pronounced in some groups.	Agency
21	14	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	Nationally-published figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between national education systems and ISCED; or differences in coverage (i.e. the extent to which different types of education – e.g. private or special education – or different types of programmes e.g. adult education or early childhood care and education - are included in one rather than the other) and/or between national and the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) population data.	Agency
21	14	6	Process of obtaining data	The UIS produces time series based on enrolment data reported by education ministries or national statistical offices and UN population estimates. These data are gathered through questionnaires sent annually to countries which are typically completed by ministries of education and/or national statistical offices. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in ISCED to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators. The data received by UIS are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors &amp; inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual “country review” of indicators. National data derived from administrative records are not necessarily based on the same classification over time and may not be comparable with data for other countries, unless exactly the same classification is used. Enrolments data compiled by UNESO are adjusted to be consistent with the ISCED and are therefore comparable across countries. The UIS also, if necessary, adjusts nationally reported data in order to take account either of under-reporting (i.e. data gaps) or over-reporting (i.e. inclusion of education programmes not covered by its surveys) before calculating indicators. In such cases, the results – if published – will normally be designated as UIS estimates (denoted by ** in UIS publications).	Agency
21	14	7	Treatment of missing values	The UIS estimates certain key items of data that may be missing or incomplete. Where data for a country are entirely missing or where an estimate is not based on evidence from or about the country directly, the UIS does not publish the resulting country-level estimates. They are used only for the purposes of calculating regional or global aggregates or averages. For the purposes of calculating the primary Adjusted Net Enrolment Rate, the UIS may make one or more of the following adjustments: 1. To account for over- or under-reporting, for example: (i) To exclude enrolments in other programmes which have been reported together with enrolments at the primary level, (ii) To include enrolments in a type of education – such as private education or special education – not reported by the country, and/or (iii) To include enrolments in a part of the country not reported by the country. 2. An estimate of the number of enrolments in the official age group for primary education (as distinct from total enrolments in primary education). 3. A redistribution of enrolments of unknown age (across known ages including the official age group for primary education). 4. An estimate of the population in the official age group for primary education for small countries (if neither UNPD nor the country itself can provide estimates of their own). In all cases there is an attempt, in the first instance, to base estimates on evidence from the country itself (e.g. information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via correspondence, publications or data on the ministry’s or National Statistical Offices (NSO’s) Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other organisations). These figures may be published: as observed data (if the missing items are found in national source or the country submits them), as national estimates (if the country is persuaded to produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data) or as UIS estimates (if the estimates are made by the UIS). Population estimates by age for countries with small population – produced only where there are no other suitable estimates available either from UNPD or from the country itself – are made only for countries which have reported education data to the UIS and for which population estimates from a reliable source are available in some years.	Agency
21	14	8	Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity	The primary adjusted NER is available for around 140 countries. Data are published for most countries approximately 15 months after the end of the school year, and 21 months for countries with split school year. A few countries, mainly from the second group, report more up-to-date data to the Institute and these are published more quickly (9 months after the end of the school year). Net enrolment rates produced by UIS are available on an annual basis. The UNPD estimates of population by individual years of age are revised biennially, although estimates may be based on population censuses conducted every 10 years in most countries. Enrollment data are recorded regularly by ministries of education and are available on a yearly basis.	Agency

22	15	2	International agreed definition	The number of students enrolled in a given level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the theoretical age group for the same level of education.	Agency
22	15	3	Method of computation	To calculate the indicator one must first determine the population of official school age by reference to the theoretical starting age and duration of ISCED Levels 2 and 3 (lower and upper secondary education) as reported by the country. Then, the total number of students enrolled in secondary education regardless of age is divided by the population of the official age-group for that level of education and the result is multiplied by 100.

24	17	2	International agreed definition	Ratio of girls to boys (gender parity index) in primary, secondary and tertiary education is the ratio of the number of female students enrolled at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education to the number of male students in each level. To standardise the effects of the population structure of the appropriate age groups, the Gender Parity Index (GPI) of the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for each level of education is used. The GER is the number of pupils enrolled in a given level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the theoretical age group for the same level of education.	Agency
24	17	3	Method of computation	To calculate the Gross Enrolment Ratio one must first determine the population of official school age for each level of education by reference to the theoretical starting ages and durations of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) Level 1 (primary education) and Levels 2 and 3 (secondary education) as reported by the country. The population of the official age for tertiary education is the 5-year age group immediately following the end of secondary education. Then, the number of pupils or students enrolled in each level of education is divided by the population of official school age for that level of education, and the result is multiplied by 100. The Gross Enrolment Ratios for males and females are calculated separately. The Gender Parity Index (GPI) is then calculated by dividing the female Gross Enrolment Ratio by the male Gross Enrolment Ratio for the given level of education. This method requires information on the structure of education (i.e. theoretical entrance age and duration of ISCED Level 1 and Levels 2 and 3), enrolments in each level of education and the populations of the age-groups corresponding to the given levels of education. Separate figures for males and females are required.	Agency

An estimate of the population in the official age group for primary education (if neither UNPD nor the country itself can provide estimates of their own) In all cases there is an attempt, in the first instance, to base estimates on evidence from the country itself (e.g. information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via correspondence, publications or data on the ministry’s or National Statistical Offices (NSO’s) Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other organisations). These figures may be published: as observed data (if the missing items are found in national source or the country submits them), as national estimates (if the country is persuaded to produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data) or as UIS estimates (if the estimates are made by the UIS). Population estimates by age for countries with small population – produced only where there are no other suitable estimates available either from UNPD or from the country itself – are made only for countries which have reported education data to the UIS and for which population estimates from a reliable source are available in some years.

24	17	8	Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity	The GPI of the Gross Enrolment Ratio is available for around 180 countries for primary education, over 170 for secondary education and over 160 for tertiary education. It should be noted that there is no tertiary education provision in about ten countries worldwide and hence, no tertiary GER. Data are published 15 months after the end of the school reference year for countries with calendar school year, and 21 months for countries with split school year. A few countries, mainly from the second group, report more up-to-date data to the Institute and these are published more quickly (9 months after the end of the school year). Gender parity indices of the Gross enrolment ratios produced by UNESCO Institute for Statistics are available on an annual basis. The United Nations Population Division estimates population by individual years of age biennially, although estimates may be based on population censuses conducted every 10 years in most countries.

24	18	2	International agreed definition	Ratio of girls to boys (gender parity index) in primary, secondary and tertiary education is the ratio of the number of female students enrolled at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education to the number of male students in each level. To standardise the effects of the population structure of the appropriate age groups, the Gender Parity Index (GPI) of the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for each level of education is used. The GER is the number of pupils enrolled in a given level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the theoretical age group for the same level of education.	Agency
24	18	3	Method of computation	To calculate the Gross Enrolment Ratio one must first determine the population of official school age for each level of education by reference to the theoretical starting ages and durations of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) Level 1 (primary education) and Levels 2 and 3 (secondary education) as reported by the country. The population of the official age for tertiary education is the 5-year age group immediately following the end of secondary education. Then, the number of pupils or students enrolled in each level of education is divided by the population of official school age for that level of education, and the result is multiplied by 100. The Gross Enrolment Ratios for males and females are calculated separately. The Gender Parity Index (GPI) is then calculated by dividing the female Gross Enrolment Ratio by the male Gross Enrolment Ratio for the given level of education. This method requires information on the structure of education (i.e. theoretical entrance age and duration of ISCED Level 1 and Levels 2 and 3), enrolments in each level of education and the populations of the age-groups corresponding to the given levels of education. Separate figures for males and females are required.	Agency
24	18	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	In situations of limited resources, families make difficult choices about sending their children to school. They may perceive the value of education differently for boys and girls. Girls are more likely than boys to suffer from limited access to education, especially in rural areas. But where basic education is widely accepted and overall enrolment is high, girls tend to equal or outnumber boys at primary and secondary levels. The pattern is similar in higher education, but with larger differences between the two sexes.	Agency
24	18	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	Country figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between national education systems and ISCED, or differences in coverage (i.e. the extent to which different types of education – e.g. private or special education – or different types of programmes e.g. adult education or early childhood care and education - are included in one rather than the other) and/or between national and UNPD population data.	Agency
24	18	6	Process of obtaining data	The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) produces time series based on enrolments reported by education ministries or national statistical offices and UN population estimates. These data are gathered through questionnaires sent annually to countries which are typically completed by ministries of education and/or national statistical offices. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in ISCED to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators. The data received by UIS are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors &amp; inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data in order that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in our annual “country review” of indicators. The UIS also, if necessary, adjusts nationally reported data in order to take account either of under-reporting (i.e. data gaps) or over-reporting (i.e. inclusion of education programmes not covered by its surveys) before calculating indicators. In such cases, the results – if published – will normally be designated as UIS estimates (denoted by ** in UIS publications)	Agency
24	18	7	Treatment of missing values	The UIS estimates certain key items of data that may be missing or incomplete. Where data for a country are entirely missing or where an estimate is not based on evidence from or about the country directly, the UIS does not publish the resulting country-level estimates. They are used only for the purposes of calculating regional or global aggregates or averages. For the purposes of calculating the secondary Gender Parity Index, the UIS may need to make one or more of the following types of adjustments: 1. To account for over- or under-reporting, for example: (i) To exclude enrolments in other programmes which have been reported together with enrolments at the secondary level, (ii) To include enrolments in a type of education – such as private education or special education – not reported by the country, and/or (iii) To include enrolments in a part of the country not reported by the country. 2.

28	21	3	Method of computation	To calculate the indicator, one must first determine the population of the theoretical entrance age to the last grade of primary by reference to the theoretical starting age and duration of primary education (ISCED Level 1) as reported by the country. Then, the number of new entrants in the last grade of primary education, irrespective of age, is divided by the population of the theoretical entrance age to the last grade of primary, and the result is multiplied by 100. This method requires information on the structure of education (i.e. theoretical entrance age and duration of ISCED Level 1), enrolment and repeaters in the last grade of primary education, and population of the theoretical entrance age to the last grade of primary.	Agency
28	21	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	The primary completion rate is a proxy measure of current outcomes of primary education. In practice, it is a measure of those entering the last grade of primary for the first time. The assumption is that the vast majority will reach the end of that last grade and thus complete the primary cycle. As a measure of the effectiveness of the primary education system, it is often seen as a proxy measure of social progress and economic achievement. Reasons for failing to reach the last grade may include non-attendance, low quality of schooling, difficulties in attending school or dropping out at an earlier stage of the primary cycle. Differences in primary completion rates between girls and boys will often reflect inequalities at other stages of the education process though once in school, girls can progress more quickly than boys and may be more likely to complete primary education.	Agency
28	21	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	Country figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between the national education system and ISCED, or differences in coverage (i.e. the extent to which different types of education – e.g. private or special education – or different types of programmes e.g. adult education or early childhood care and education - are included in one rather than the other) and/or between national and UNPD population data.	Agency
28	21	6	Process of obtaining data	The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) produces time series based on enrolments and repeaters data reported by education ministries or national statistical offices and UN population estimates. Enrolments and repeaters by grade are gathered through questionnaires sent annually to countries which are typically completed by ministries of education and/or national statistical offices. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in ISCED to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators. The data received by UIS are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors &amp; inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data in order that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in our annual “country review” of indicators. The UIS also, if necessary, adjusts nationally reported data in order to take account either of under-reporting (i.e. data gaps) or over-reporting (i.e. inclusion of education programmes not covered by its surveys) before calculating indicators. In such cases, the results – if published – will normally be designated as UIS estimates (denoted by ** in UIS publications).	Agency
28	21	7	Treatment of missing values	The UIS estimates certain key items of data that may be missing or incomplete. Where data for a country are entirely missing or where an estimate is not based on evidence from or about the country directly, the UIS does not publish the resulting country-level estimates. They are used only for the purposes of calculating regional or global aggregates or averages. For the purposes of calculating the proxy Primary Education Completion Rate, the UIS may make one or more of the following adjustments: 1. To account for over- or under-reporting, for example: (i) To exclude enrolments in other programmes which have been reported together with enrolments at the primary level, (ii) To include enrolments in a type of education – such as private education or special education – not reported by the country, and/or (iii) To include enrolments in a part of the country not reported by the country. 2. An estimate of the population in the official age group for primary education for small countries (if neither UNPD nor the country itself can provide estimates of their own). In all cases there is an attempt, in the first instance, to base estimates on evidence from the country itself (eg information from the data provider on the size of the missing component, via correspondence, publications or data on the ministry’s or National Statistical Offices (NSO’s) Webpage, or via surveys conducted by other organisations). These figures may be published: as observed data (if the missing items are found in national source or the country submits them), as national estimates (if the country is persuaded to produce estimates and submit them in place of missing data) or as UIS estimates (if the estimates are made by the UIS). Population estimates by age for countries with small population – produced only where there are no other suitable estimates available either from UNPD or from the country itself – are made only for countries which have reported education data to the UIS and for which population estimates from a reliable source are available in some years.	Agency
28	21	8	Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity	Gross Intake Ratio to Last Grade of primary is available for around 160 countries. Data are published 15 months after the end of the school reference year for countries with calendar school year, and 21 months for countries with split school year. A few countries, mainly from the second group, report more up-to-date data to the Institute and these are published more quickly (9 months after the end of the school year). Gross Intake Ratios to Last Grade of primary produced by UNESCO Institute for Statistics are available on an annual basis. The United Nations Population Division estimates of population by individual years of age are revised biennially, although estimates may be based on population censuses conducted every 10 years in most countries.

29	22	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	The lower secondary gross graduation ratio is a broad measure of current outcomes of lower secondary education which in many countries marks the end of compulsory education. As a measure of the effectiveness of the primary and secondary education systems, it is often seen as a proxy measure of social progress and economic achievement. Reasons for failing to graduate from lower secondary education may include non-attendance, low quality of schooling, difficulties in attending school, failing to transfer from primary to secondary education or dropping out at an earlier stage of the education cycle. Differences in lower secondary gross graduation ratios between girls and boys will often reflect inequalities at other stages of the education process.	Agency
29	22	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	Nationally-published figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between national education systems and ISCED, or differences in coverage (i.e. the extent to which different types of education – e.g. private or special education – or different types of programmes e.g. adult education or early childhood care and education - are included in one rather than the other) and/or between national and the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) population data.

In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual “country review” of indicators. National data derived from administrative records are not necessarily based on the same classification over time and may not be comparable with data for other countries, unless exactly the same classification is used. Enrolments data compiled by UNESO are adjusted to be consistent with the ISCED and are therefore comparable across countries. The UIS also, if necessary, adjusts nationally reported data in order to take account either of under-reporting (i.e. data gaps) or over-reporting (i.e. inclusion of education programmes not covered by its surveys) before calculating indicators.

30	23	2	International agreed definition	The number of new entrants to the first grade of secondary general education in a given year expressed as a percentage of the pupils enrolled in the last grade of primary education in the previous year who do not repeat that grade the following year. It measures the probability that that a pupil in the last grade of primary education makes the transition to secondary general education.	Agency
30	23	3	Method of computation	The number of enrolments minus repeaters in grade 1 of secondary general education in year t divided by the number of enrolments in the last grade of primary education in year t-1 minus the repeaters in the last grade of primary education in year t. The result is multiplied by 100.	Agency
30	23	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	This indicator aims to assess gender disparity with regard to access to secondary education.

31	46	3	Method of computation	Divide the number of persons aged 25 years and older who completed at least lower secondary education by the total population of the same age group and multiply the result by 100. The levels of education used for this indicator are those defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED).	Agency
31	46	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Educational attainment of the population aged 25 years and older reflects access to primary, secondary and tertiary education over the previous decades. Educational attainment is a measure of the human capital of individuals and entire nations. Reasons for low educational attainment include non-attendance and exit from the education system before completion of higher levels of education. Differences in levels of attainment of women and men reflect inequalities in access to formal education during previous decades and persisting inequalities in adult life and the world of work.	Agency
31	46	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	National data on educational attainment are often collected and reported in reference to national systems of education. The UIS reports data on educational attainment as classified in reference to ISCED. The mapping from a national classification to ISCED is not always straightforward and can cause discrepancies between attainment levels in national and international data.	Agency
31	46	6	Process of obtaining data	The UIS collects global attainment data on an annual basis. Countries and territories are asked to report counts of the population by the highest level of education attained, disaggregated by five-year age group, sex and location (urban or rural). The data are usually reported by national statistical offices. Population and housing censuses are an important source of attainment data. These data are usually collected together with other household characteristics concerning an individual’s educational, demographic and socio-economic status. The attainment status can be collected through self- or household declaration. In the former case, each household member above a certain age reports his or her own level of educational attainment. In the latter case, one person, usually the head of the household, indicates the highest qualification held or level of education completed of each member of the household. Data are usually mapped to the ISCED levels post-enumeration. National sample surveys, especially labour force surveys, are another source of attainment data. If such surveys are not regularly repeated they may not be a consistently reliable data source over time. International sample surveys, such as UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), are a third source. These surveys are designed to meet commonly agreed upon international data needs while also providing data for national policy purposes. Modules on attainment are often standardized across countries to be internationally comparable and may not collect very detailed data. These surveys are implemented on a regular basis in selected countries. They aim to assure cross-national comparability although they often integrate national modules to suit specific country data needs. Modules from international surveys are sometimes added to other on-going national sample surveys. The UIS conducts internal consistency checks in order to ensure the accuracy of the data provided. This is done by comparing attainment data for a country from different sources, across different years, and across countries in the same region.	Agency
31	46	7	Treatment of missing values	Aggregate data reported to the UIS during its annual survey on educational attainment often combine data for different levels of attainment, for example by combining the percentage of the population with incomplete or complete primary education in a single figure instead of reporting the data for each level of attainment separately. In its database and publications, the UIS indicates which levels of education were combined in national reporting. Regional averages are not calculated for attainment data and no data are imputed for countries without attainment data.	Agency
31	46	8	Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity	Data are available for about 150 countries although the availability varies by region. Availability is high in North America and Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean. By contrast, few countries in sub-Saharan Africa report attainment data to the UIS, usually because data collection systems are weak.	Agency

In the latter case, one person, usually the head of the household, indicates the highest qualification held or level of education completed of each member of the household. Data are usually mapped to the ISCED levels post-enumeration. National sample surveys, especially labour force surveys, are another source of attainment data. If such surveys are not regularly repeated they may not be a consistently reliable data source over time. International sample surveys, such as UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), are a third source. These surveys are designed to meet commonly agreed upon international data needs while also providing data for national policy purposes. Modules on attainment are often standardized across countries to be internationally comparable and may not collect very detailed data. These surveys are implemented on a regular basis in selected countries. They aim to assure cross-national comparability although they often integrate national modules to suit specific country data needs. Modules from international surveys are sometimes added to other on-going national sample surveys. The UIS conducts internal consistency checks in order to ensure the accuracy of the data provided. This is done by comparing attainment data for a country from different sources, across different years, and across countries in the same region.	Agency

31	54	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Educational attainment of the population aged 25 years and older reflects access to primary, secondary and tertiary education over the previous decades. Educational attainment is a measure of the human capital of individuals and entire nations. Reasons for low educational attainment include non-attendance and exit from the education system before completion of higher levels of education. Differences in levels of attainment of women and men reflect inequalities in access to formal education during previous decades and persisting inequalities in adult life and the world of work.	Agency
31	54	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	National data on educational attainment are often collected and reported in reference to national systems of education. The UIS reports data on educational attainment as classified in reference to ISCED. The mapping from a national classification to ISCED is not always straightforward and can cause discrepancies between attainment levels in national and international data.	Agency
31	54	6	Process of obtaining data	The UIS collects global attainment data on an annual basis. Countries and territories are asked to report counts of the population by the highest level of education attained, disaggregated by five-year age group, sex and location (urban or rural). The data are usually reported by national statistical offices. Population and housing censuses are an important source of attainment data. These data are usually collected together with other household characteristics concerning an individual’s educational, demographic and socio-economic status. The attainment status can be collected through self- or household declaration. In the former case, each household member above a certain age reports his or her own level of educational attainment.

32	25	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who desire either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next child and who are currently using a modern contraceptive method.

  Rationale: 

The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies , which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are generally considered as very low.

  Concepts: 

The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning. 

Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used. Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age, either married or in a union, who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception.

For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately.

  Comments and limitations: 

Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by “currently using” a method of contraception.

In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (according to method, age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analyzing trends over time.

When data on married or in-union women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for the next most comparable group of persons is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), ever-married women, or men and women who are married or in a union. Notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or where data pertain to populations that are not representative of all married or in-union women of reproductive age."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
32	25	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

The numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method. The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning). Estimates are with respect to women who are married or in a union.

  Indicator 32a refers to national data while indicator 32b contains estimates from UN Population Division. Estimates are obtained from a systematic and comprehensive set of annual, model-based estimates and projections for a collection of family planning indicators, including contraceptive prevalence, the unmet need for family planning and the demand for family planning satisfied by use of contraception (any method or modern methods alone). All results pertain to married or in-union women and cover the period from 1970 to 2030. Estimates are provided for 185 countries or areas. The results are based on data available as of February 2018. A Bayesian hierarchical model combined with country-specific time trends was used to generate the estimates, projections and uncertainty assessments. The model accounts for differences by data source in the characteristics of the sample population and in the contraceptive methods included in survey-based estimates of prevalence. Details of the methodology are described in: Alkema L., V. Kantorova, C. Menozzi and A. Biddlecom (2013). National, regional and global rates and trends in contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning between 1990 and 2015: a systematic and comprehensive analysis. The Lancet. Vol. 381, Issue 9878, pp. 1642– 1652. The model-based estimates and projections were derived from survey-based estimates by country, as compiled in: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2018) World Contraceptive Use 2018.

32	25	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Access to and use of an effective means of contraception to prevent pregnancy enables women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children. Shortfalls in women’s empowerment are closely intertwined with shortfalls in reproductive rights. Gender discrimination can negatively influence health systems, for instance, so that women cannot access the reproductive health services and information, including family planning, and might be limited in their choices of types of contraception. At the household level, when women are not involved in household decision-making or are subjected to gender-based violence, they may have little control over their reproductive life, including use of contraceptives. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to preventing unintended pregnancies, which are at higher risks of poor maternal and child health outcomes.	Agency

33	26	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births.

  Rationale: 

Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition.

  Concepts: 

The under-five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
33	26	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from national data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B-splines bias-reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under-five mortality for all countries. See references for details. 

For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:

Civil registration: The under-five mortality rate can be derived from a standard period abridged life table using the age-specific deaths and mid-year population counts from civil registration data to calculate death rates, which are then converted into age-specific probabilities of dying.

Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on a summary birth history, a series of questions asked of each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under-five and infant mortality rates. Censuses often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.

Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from full birth history module."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
33	26	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	In settings where there is no gender-based discrimination in the care and treatment of young children, under-five mortality rates are higher for boys than for girls due to biological factors that tend to favour girls, especially in early infancy. The degree of expected female advantage varies according to the overall level of mortality and the profile of causes of death. Thus, equal rates of under-five mortality for boys and girls would actually be considered an indication that girls are suffering disadvantage in survival._x000D_ The effects of gender discrimination on child survival become more apparent after early infancy, because nutrition and medical interventions are more important determinants of survival among older infants and young children. Because of the relative weight of neonatal deaths in overall under-five mortality, girls’ advantage in the neonatal period may mask disadvantage in later ages when considering the under-five mortality rate. To better assess gender differences in mortality among children under-five, it is preferable to disaggregate mortality rates by age, considering separately mortality under age one (infant mortality) and at ages 1-4.	http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/4-1-Under-five-mortality-rate.ashx
33	26	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	"Sources of discrepancies: 

The UN IGME estimates are derived based on national data. Countries often use a single source as their official estimates or apply methods different from the UN IGME methods to derive estimates. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data has good quality.

Many countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the last several decades. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of under-five mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. Each new survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, including previous data. Data suffer from sampling or non-sampling errors (such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of child deaths is also common). UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Furthermore, the latest data produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also projects estimates to a common reference year. In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. Applying a consistent methodology also allows for comparisons between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. UN IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses original empirical data from each country but does not report figures produced by individual countries using other methods, which would not be comparable to other country estimates."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
33	26	6	Process of obtaining data	"Description: 

Nationally-representative estimates of child mortality can be derived from a number of different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases, household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.

Civil registration

Civil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of the under-five and infant mortality rates from civil registration data is derived from a standard period abridged life table. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.

Population census and household survey data

The majority of survey data comes in one of two forms: the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death; and the summary birth history (SBH), whereby women are asked only about the number of their children ever born and the number that have died (or equivalently the number still alive).

  Collection process: 

For under-five mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publically and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO. 

Adjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of under-five mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UNIGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the under-five mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data, UN IGME adjusts the estimates for crisis mortality.

Then the UN IGME conducts an annual country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, and notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices and to Ministries of Health or relevant agencies for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or relevant agencies review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data, send feedback or comments, and sometimes supply additional empirical data .

To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal: CME Info (www.childmortality.org). It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, CME Info will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

34	27	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.

Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.

  Rationale: 

All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2015 estimation round include a point-estimate and an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). For those indicators where only point-estimates are reported in the text or tables, UIs can be obtained from supplementary material online (http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2015/en/). Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates.

For example: 

The estimated 2015 global MMR is 216 (UI 207 to 249)

This means:

• The point-estimate is 216 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 207 to 249.

• There is a 50% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 216, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 216.

• There is an 80% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies between 207 and 249.

• There is still a 10% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 249, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 207.

Other accurate interpretations include:

• We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is at least 207.

• We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is 249 or less.

The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width of an indicator’s UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicator’s true value lies close to the point-estimate.

Definitions related to maternal death in ICD-10

Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental causes.

Pregnancy-related death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.

Late maternal death: The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days, but less than one year after termination of pregnancy

  Comments and limitations: 

The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:

i. The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.

ii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).

The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.

By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population (see Box A2.2). An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15–49 years.

All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2015 estimation round include a point-estimate and an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). For those indicators where only point-estimates are reported in the text or tables, UIs can be obtained from supplementary material online (http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2015/en/). Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates.

For example: 

The estimated 2015 global MMR is 216 (UI 207 to 249)

This means:

• The point-estimate is 216 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 207 to 249.

• There is a 50% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 216, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 216.

• There is an 80% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies between 207 and 249.

• There is still a 10% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 249, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 207.

Other accurate interpretations include:

• We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is at least 207.

• We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is 249 or less.

The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width of an indicator’s UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicator’s true value lies close to the point-estimate.

  Concepts: 

Definitions related to maternal death in ICD-10

Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental causes.

Pregnancy-related death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.

Late maternal death: The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days, but less than one year after termination of pregnancy

  Comments and limitations: 

The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:

i. The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.

ii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).

The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.

By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population (see Box A2.2). An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15–49 years.

34	27	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.

The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. Some countries undertake these adjustments or corrections as part of specialized/confidential enquiries or administrative efforts embedded within maternal mortality monitoring programmes."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

34	27	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	The low social and economic status of girls and women is a fundamental determinant of maternal mortality in many countries. Low status limits the access of girls and women to education, good nutrition and family planning—key determinants of too early, too many, and risky pregnancies—as well as to the necessary health services to prevent and/or treat complications of pregnancy and childbirth.	http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/5-1-Maternal-mortality-ratio.ashx#p7

34	27	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	"Sources of discrepancies: 

The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths divided by live births. However, to account for potential incompleteness of death recording in various data sources, the MMEIG first computes the fraction of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the “proportion maternal”, or PM), and then applies that fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. 

In other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data sources:

PM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 

and then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:

MMR=PM ×(All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)

where the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is derived from WHO life tables, and the number of live births is from the World Population Prospects 2015.

With this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from national statistics are as follows:

1. Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.

2. The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined “maternal” deaths; misclassification; or undercounting). 

3. The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2015, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the UNPD. The contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. 

4. Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk"	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/194254/1/9789241565141\_eng.pdf?ua=1

  Collection process: 

The MMEIG maintains an input database consisting of maternal mortality data from civil registration, population based surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, and other specialized studies/surveys. This database is used to determine the number of maternal deaths and where possible the number of deaths among all women of reproductive age (WRA) to calculate the ""PM"" proportion of maternal deaths among WRA. The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where ""D"" is the number of deaths in women aged 15-49 (WRA) and ""B"" is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects.

Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable Country, Regional, and Global level estimates. The model''s fit is assessed by cross-validation. Estimates are then reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB.107.R8) seeking to “establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions”. A key objective of this consultation process is “to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used”. Since the process is an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.

The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary estimates.

Adjustments are made according to the data source type:

(1) CRVS, for underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths

(2) reports providing ""pregnancy-related"" mortality, for underreporting of these deaths, as well as over-reporting of maternal deaths due to inclusion of deaths which are accidental or incidental to pregnancy (thus outside of the definition of maternal mortality). 

The analysis also accounts for stochastic errors due to the general rarity of maternal deaths, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

36	30	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel as defined as the percentage of live births attended by skilled health personnel during a specified time period, generally up to the past five years.

  Rationale: 

The proportion of birth attended by skilled health personnel provides an indicator of access by pregnant women to appropriate delivery care that can provide quality management of labor and delivery, assess obstetric risks, treat and refer appropriately. When disaggregated by relevant socio-economic and geographic stratifiers, the indicator helps identified areas and groups that are not being reached with appropriate delivery care. The indicator, however, indicates only contact with a qualified health personnel and does not provide an indication of the quality of care provided or whether women receive all necessary interventions.

  Concepts: 

The joint Statement by WHO/ICM/FIGO defines the skilled birth attendant as “an accredited health professional — such as a midwife, doctor or nurse — who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal (uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and in the identification, management and referral of complications in women and newborns”.

  Comments and limitations: 

Although the indicator has been measured and reported on for decades at country, regional and global level, data to measure it remain challenged with many limitations. Most data from low and middle income countries are from household surveys and therefore based on women’s recall of the health worker who mainly assisted with delivery and their perception of the type of cadre (whether doctor, nurse, midwife or other). In addition, definition of skilled health personnel varies largely across countries, and includes non-standard list of cadres of health workers, which can lead to serious misclassification in terms of skills. Furthermore, categories of cadres of health workers used in survey questions are not standard but vary across surveys and between countries. Finally, the indicator only provides an indication of level of contact with the health system. It does not indicate level of quality of care, nor receipt of all necessary high impact interventions."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
36	30	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

The indicator is computed as the number of live births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) out of total number of live births in a specified reference period. Data generally come from household surveys or health information system.

In national household surveys, such as DHS and MICS, women aged 15-49 who report live births in a specified recent period (up to five years before the interview), are asked about the person who assisted the delivery of each of the live births reported. Information collected is used to determined births attended by a skilled health personnel. Service/facility records could be used where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities and are recorded in the health information system"	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
36	30	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Having a skilled attendant at the time of delivery is an important life saving intervention for both mothers and babies. Not having access to this key assistance is detrimental to women''s health and gender empowerment because it could cause the death of the mother or long lasting disability, especially in marginalized settings.

Sources of difference may come from differences in definition and cadres considered as skilled health personnel."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
36	30	6	Process of obtaining data	"Description: 

Data sources for measuring this indicator are nationally representative household surveys and health facility records. Nationally representative household surveys include surveys such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS, mics.unicef.org) and the USAID-funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS, dhsprogram.com). These surveys use nationally representative samples based on a two-stage cluster sampling, generally using a population census frame of enumeration areas. Final sample size includes several thousand households. Interviews are carried out with head of households, all women of reproductive age (generally 15-49) and, in the case of MICS, mothers/caretakers of children under-five. Denominator for the indicator is based on all live births reported by women of reproductive age on period up to five years preceding the survey. Despite slight variation in the determination of the denomination between surveys (for example, MICS uses last live births in the past two years while DHS uses all lives births in the past five years), the level of the indicator has been fairly comparable across surveys and overtime. 

Data from health facility records are reliable only in countries where almost all deliveries occur in health facilities, resulting in generally very high level of births attended by skilled health personnel.

  Collection process: 

UNICEF has established a web-based data source identification and data compilation system working with all countries offices. Data reported through nationally representative surveys (e.g. DHS and MICS) are compiled and carefully reviewed to ensure sound survey methodology, consistency definition, and accurate method of computation. The web-based system is complemented by an online search carried out by WHO of survey reports and data published in countries. Adjustment may be made to the reported value of the indicator to ensure consistency with the definition. In these cases, data presented in survey reports may be different from those reported in the global databases."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

World Health Organization; 

Secretariat of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
37	31	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

The indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis.

  Rationale: 

Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of SDG Target 3.a “Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate”.

  Concepts: 

Tobacco use means use of smoked and/or smokeless tobacco products. “Current use” means use within the previous 30 days at the time of the survey, whether daily or non-daily use.

Tobacco products means products entirely or partly made of the leaf tobacco as raw material intended for human consumption through smoking, sucking, chewing or sniffing. 

“Smoked tobacco products” include cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, cheroots, bidis, pipes, shisha (water pipes), roll-your-own tobacco, kretek and any other form of tobacco that is consumed by smoking.

""Smokeless tobacco product"" includes moist snuff, creamy snuff, dry snuff, plug, dissolvables, gul, loose leaf, red tooth powder, snus, chimo, gutkha, khaini, gudakhu, zarda, quiwam, dohra, tuibur, nasway, naas, naswar, shammah, toombak, paan (betel quid with tobacco), iq’mik, mishri, tapkeer, tombol and any other tobacco product that consumed by sniffing, holding in the mouth or chewing.

Prevalence estimates have been “age-standardized” to make them comparable across all countries no matter the demographic profile of the country. This is done by applying each country’s age-and-sex specific prevalence rates to the WHO Standard Population. The resulting rates are hypothetical numbers which are only meaningful when comparing rates obtained for one country

with those obtained for another country.

  Comments and limitations: 

Raw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used to calculate comparable estimates for this indicator. Information from subnational surveys are not used. 

While less than 1 in 5 countries are currently reporting on all types of tobacco use, three-quarters of countries have robust data on tobacco smoking. Until the majority of countries are reporting on all types of tobacco use (smoked and smokeless), this indicator will be populated with tobacco smoking rates. In some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries, smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree. 

The comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the estimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age ranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different tobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country’s perception of which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored simultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of e-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries’ definitions of tobacco use. The definition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, surveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use. 

There is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use. WHO’s Tobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve comparability of indicators across countries."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
37	31	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco smoking for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966–976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is “borrowed” from countries in the same UN sub-region. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population.

Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.

39	33	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Gender inequalities and harmful gender norms are important drivers of the HIV epidemic and hamper women’s ability to protect themselves from HIV and/or to assert healthy sexual decision making, as well as reduce access to essential HIV and sexual and reproductive health services. Limitations of the indicator:  Improved methods, enhanced data and improved estimation tools are enabling a better understanding of the degrees of uncertainty that surround HIV estimates. This is part of an ongoing process of improving estimates and developing appropriate ranges—all of which are vital for effective HIV planning and programming at national and regional levels. Because the quality of data varies from country to country, the ranges of uncertainty surrounding estimates can widen or narrow depending on the country. The ranges reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with estimates and define the boundaries within which the actual numbers lie. Four factors determine the extent of the ranges around the HIV estimates: (i) The HIV prevalence level – Ranges tend to be smaller when HIV prevalence is higher.  (ii) The quality of the data – Countries with better quality data have smaller ranges than countries with poorer quality data. The ranges for Asia and the Pacific are comparatively broad—which reflects the fact that HIV surveillance of key populations (such as injecting drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men) is relatively poor in some countries in that region, hence resulting in more uncertainty. In general, the ranges for sub-Saharan Africa are narrower, because of recent improvements in the collection and interpretation of HIV data in that region (including the availability of a national survey for most countries). (iii) The number of steps or assumptions used to arrive at an estimate – The more steps and assumptions, the wider the uncertainty range is likely to be (since each step introduces additional uncertainties). For example, ranges around estimates of adult HIV prevalence are smaller than those around estimates of HIV incidence among children, which require additional data on the probability of mother-to-child HIV transmission. The latter are based on prevalence among pregnant women, the probability of mother-to-child HIV transmission, and estimated survival times for HIV-positive children. There is therefore greater uncertainty in these estimates than for adult prevalence alone. (iv) The type of epidemic (generalized or low-level/concentrated)– Ranges tend to be wider in countries with low-level or concentrated epidemics than in countries with generalized epidemics because in low-level or concentrated epidemics, one needs to estimate both the numbers of people in the groups at higher risk of HIV infection and HIV prevalence rates. Assumptions, methodologies and data used to produce the estimates are gradually changing as a result of ongoing enhancement in our knowledge of the epidemic; hence most recent estimates should not be compared with those published in previous years. HIstorical HIV estimates are updated annually during each round of estimation exercises.	Agency

41	35	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Women tend to live longer than men in all regions of the world. In nearly all countries of the world, female life expectancy at age 60 is higher than that of males; however, there are differences in the gap between female and male life expectancy by development group or geographical areas. At the world level, females have a life expectancy of 21.1 years in 2005-2010, compared to 18.2 years for males. The female advantage is considerably larger in the more developed regions (4.0 years) than in the less developed regions (2.3 years). The gap between male and female life expectancy is particularly narrow in the least developed countries (1.1 years). The indicator reflects possible gender differences in determinants of health and mortality at ages above 60, including prevalence of smoking, obesity, limited physical activity or ability of older women and men to access health care, among others. There are significant gender differences in the causes of deaths above age 60. Life expectancy at age 60 is an outcome indicator and to understand gender differences in health and mortality in this age group more detailed study of gender differences needs to be carried.	Agency
41	35	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	National demographic statistics can be affected by incompleteness of coverage, lack of timeliness and errors in the reporting or coding of the information. For the World Population Prospects, the analysis carried out by the Population Division uses the cohort-component method to reconstruct populations to ensure that the population trends and related estimates of fertility, mortality and migration are internally consistent. For many countries without complete and reliable death registration systems, national estimates of mortality above age 60 are not available. In these cases, a model life table age pattern of mortality is used to derive estimates of mortality rates above age 60. National estimates that use different methods to account for deficiencies of age-and sex-specific mortality data can be different from the life expectancy at age 60 published by the Population Division.	Agency
41	35	6	Process of obtaining data	In developed countries, mortality rates at ages above 60 can be measured using data from civil registration systems and population estimates derived from censuses or population registers. In most developing countries, however, the estimation of mortality rates above age 60 is seriously constrained by the absence of reliable, continuous, and complete data registration systems. Throughout many countries where such systems are not in place, valid measures of mortality above age 60 are not available. Other sources of information have to be incorporated, such as estimates of adult mortality below age 60 and/or child mortality estimates, which are then applied to a model life table age pattern of mortality to derive estimates of mortality rates above age 60.  Empirical observations on deaths by age and sex and age- and sex-specific mortality estimates are taken from various sources: a) For countries with death registration systems, data on deaths by age and sex are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC). Other sources, such as data reported on the national statistics website and mortality estimates from the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org) or research publications are also used. (b) For survey data, the information for calculation of adult mortality estimates below age 60 or 50 can be obtained from surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), MICS and other nationally sponsored surveys. To derive estimates for adult mortality after age 60, model life table age pattern need to be employed. (c) For census data, the data on deaths by age and sex in the last 12 or 24 months are obtained from census reports. Estimates of age-specific mortality rates from the census data are calculated by the Population Division or are obtained from census reports and research publications.

41	35	7	Treatment of missing values	Due to the lack of valid measures of mortality above age 60 for many developing countries, the levels and trends in life expectancy above age 60 described in World Population Prospects, are in some cases derived from estimates of adult mortality below age 60 and/or child mortality applied to a model life table age pattern of mortality, rather than an empirical observation of deaths above age 60.	Agency
41	35	8	Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity	Data are available for 201 countries and areas. In the World Population Prospects, the indicator is estimated for all countries or areas with more than 90,000 inhabitants as of 1 July 2013. For many countries without complete and reliable death registration systems, national estimates are not available. Estimates from other sources such as surveys and censuses can be available; however, they are related only to a specific period of time and often are not consistent with other estimates and not comparable over time.

42	42	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. 

Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods (see further details in section 3.3).

  Rationale: 

Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs in a population.

  Concepts: 

Probability of dying: The likelihood that an individual would die between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a mortality rate.

Life table: A table showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to a set of age-specific mortality rates.

Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases: ICD-10 underlying causes of death I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98.

  Comments and limitations: 

Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes and some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions reinforce the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some information on causes of death in populations without well-functioning death registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
42	42	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator:

1. Estimation of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population Prospects 2012 revision. 

2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions. 

3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs for each five-year age range between 30 and 70. 

4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.

The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of data available from countries:

For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.

For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.

The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. The ICD codes used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14, and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98 

Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of death, can be found on page 6 of this document:

42	42	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	For adult ages and at global level the top causes of death are different for women than for men. The three top causes of death for adult women are infectious and parasitic diseases; cancers; and cardiovascular diseases. The three top causes of death for adult men are injuries; cardiovascular diseases and infectious and parasitic diseases. Adult men have higher mortality rates than adult women for all these causes of death with the exception of cancers where male and female rates are similar. Across regions and countries there are variations in the ranking of the causes of death and the gender gap in adult mortality due to specific causes of death. For example in Africa the number one cause of death for both women and men is HIV/AIDS and women have a higher adult mortality rate from this cause than men. The second most prevalent cause of death is other infectious and parasitic diseases where adult men have a higher mortality rate than adult women. The third cause of death is injuries for men and maternal and nutritional conditions for women. As another example in low and middle income countries of the Americas the leading cause of death for adult women is cancers from which they have a higher mortality rate than men. For adult men the number 1 cause of death is injuries from which their rate of mortality is several times higher than women’s. (WHO 2011. Mortality estimates by cause age and sex for the year 2008)	Agency
42	42	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	"Sources of discrepancies: 

In countries with high quality vital registration systems, point estimates sometimes differ primarily for two reasons: 1) WHO redistributes deaths with ill-defined cause of death; and 2) WHO corrects for incomplete death registration."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
42	42	6	Process of obtaining data	"Description: 

The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Other possible data sources include household surveys with verbal autopsy, and sample or sentinel registration systems.

  Collection process: 

WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its cause-of-death estimates."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
42	42	7	Treatment of missing values	"Treatment of missing values: At country level:

44	37	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

The proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments, currently as at 1 February of reporting year, is currently measured as the number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.

National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.

Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, or the number of members of parliament.

  Rationale: 

The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision making. Women’s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women’s opportunities in political and public life, and is therefore linked to women’s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per cent.

A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies.

Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women’s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women’s access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policy measures to increase women’s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.

  Concepts: 

Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.

Parliaments can vary in their capacity to engage in law making, oversight of government and representation of the electorate. In terms of measuring women’s political decision-making power, this indicator may be limited because many women still face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate. Different constraints may come into play: women parliamentarians may find that they do not have the support of their peers or that the gender-based policies they advocate are at odds with the policies of the political parties they represent. Numbers do matter however, and women’s increased presence in parliament does, at a minimum, facilitate the articulation of women’s concerns and alter the gender dynamics in parliament. The role of women parliamentarians needs to be considered alongside other actors such as the executive and in the government, the national gender machinery and women’s groups in civil society.  The involvement of women in setting political priorities delivers a stronger and more representative democracy and results in better outcomes for citizens. While parliaments vary in terms of the number of women members, it is apparent that the efforts of women have resulted in more gender policies that are of benefit to them and the communities in which they are based. Women parliamentarians are the most ardent promoters and defenders of women and have redefined political priorities to include gender issues. But the role does not fall exclusively to women and more needs to be done to forge a partnership between men and women. How men can further support gender issues requires further attention.	Agency

Own-use production work (activities to produce goods and services for own final use; the intended destination of the output is mainly for final use of the producer in the form of capital formation, or final consumption by household members or by family members living in other households; in the case of agricultural, fishing, hunting or gathering goods intended mainly for own consumption, a part or surplus may nevertheless be sold or bartered)
2.   Employment (activities to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit)
3.   Unpaid trainee work (any unpaid activity to produce goods or provide services for others, in order to acquire workplace experience or skills in a trade or profession)
4.   Volunteer work (any unpaid, non-compulsory activity to produce goods or provide services for others)
5.   Other forms of work

The own-use production work can be differentiated based on whether goods or services are produced.

_This indicator only considers the own-use production work of services, or in other words, the activities related to unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services undertaken by households for their own use. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”._

As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017.

  Comments and limitations: 

Time use statistics have been used for: (1) provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of individuals and households; (2) offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; (3) produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.

International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: 

1.   Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity. 
2.   Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. 
3.   Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. 
4.   Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.

45	38	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

Data presented for this indicator are expressed as the average number of hours spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work. Weekly data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. 

Average number of hours spent in a day on relevant activities = 

(Total number of hours spent by the population on relevant activities)/(Total population (regardless of whether they participated in the activity))

Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. 

_This indicator is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. _

Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level.

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week.

This indicator is defined as the average number of hours spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”. 

  Concepts: 

_Unpaid domestic and care work _refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”.

For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. 
4.   Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
45	90	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

Data presented for this indicator are expressed as the average number of hours spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work. Weekly data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. 

Average number of hours spent in a day on relevant activities = 

(Total number of hours spent by the population on relevant activities)/(Total population (regardless of whether they participated in the activity))

Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. 

_This indicator is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. _

45	90	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Time use statistics have been used for: (a) the measurement and analysis of quality of life or general well-being; (b) a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work including unpaid and volunteer work; and (c) for the improvement of estimates on the production of goods and services with particular emphasis on increasing visibility of women’s work through better statistics on their contribution to the economy and the development of satellite accounts.International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors including: (a) diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day what activity followed and the time that activity began and ended and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period such as a day or week. Often stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. (b) Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. (c) Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. (d) The different age groups presented by countries for their data also makes time use data incomparable across countries.	Agency

48	77	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

This indicator measures the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older who have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner, in the previous 12 months. 

Definition of violence against women and girls and of the forms of violence specified under this indicator are presented in the next section (Concepts).

  Rationale: 

Violence directed at women and girls is the most common form of gender-based violence. In societies that sanction male dominance over women, violence between intimate partners may be perceived as an ordinary component of interpersonal dynamics between the sexes, particularly in the context of marriage or other formal unions. Therefore, it represents one manifestation of gender inequality.

Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk; explore the barriers to seeking help; and ensure that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies, and developing effective responses and programmes, as needed. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and assess the effectiveness of their interventions.

  Concepts: 

According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), Violence against Women is “Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family \[…\]”. See here for full definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm 

Intimate partner violence includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union.

The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: 

1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. 

2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.

3. Psychological violence includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners and are acts of violence in themselves.

For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see _Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys_ (UN, 2014).

For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see _Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys_ (UN, 2014).

For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see _Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys_ (UN, 2014).

  Comments and limitations: 

Comparability:

The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, used different definitions of partner or spousal violence and of the different forms of violence and different survey question formulations, and diverse age groups are often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.

Regularity of data production:

Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women. Obtaining data on violence against women is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
48	77	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

This indicator calls for breakdown by form of violence and by age group and yields the following for each form of violence or forms of violence:

1. Physical violence: 

Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 

2. Sexual violence: 

Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 

3. Psychological violence: 

Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100 

4. Any form of physical and/or sexual violence: 

Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100

5. Any form of physical, sexual and/or psychological violence:

Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical, sexual and/or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100

48	77	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Violence against women is a serious problem that affects women globally. It is a violation of women’s human rights and has negative consequences for their physical emotional and social wellbeing and ability to participate in civil society. On a broader scale violence against women interferes with the social economic and political development of societies.Intimate partner violence is traumatic and debilitating. Victims often feel they have nowhere toturn especially in societies where it is difficult for women to leave their husbands or live-in partners and live alone. Women who have suffered from intimate partner violence are more likely to give birth to a low-birthweight baby have an abortion and experience depression.Despite the increase in the availability and quality of data on violence against women significant challenges remain.

The main sources of intimate partner violence prevalence data are (1) specialized national surveys dedicated to measuring violence against women and (2) international household surveys that include a module on experiences of violence by women, such as the DHS.

Although administrative data from health, police, courts, justice and social services, among other services used by survivors of violence, can provide information on violence against women and girls, these do not produce prevalence data, but rather incidence data or number of cases received in/reported to these services. We know that many abused women do not report violence and those who do, tend to be only the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data should not be used as a data source for this indicator.

49	78	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

This indicator measures the percentage of women and girls aged 15 years and older who have experienced sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner, in the previous 12 months. 

Definition of sexual violence against women and girls is presented in the next section (Concepts).

  Rationale: 

Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations in the world. Evidence has shown that globally, an estimated 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner at some point in their lives (WHO et al., 2013). Having data on this indicator will help understand the extent and nature of this form of violence and develop appropriate policies and programmes.

  Concepts:

Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: \[…\], Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution \[…\]”.

Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. However, in most surveys that collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the information collected is limited to forcing someone into sexual intercourse when she does not want to, as well as attempting to force someone to perform a sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual intercourse. 

For a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see _Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys_ (UN, 2014).

  Comments and limitations: 

Comparability:

The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies and used different definitions of sexual violence and different survey question formulation. Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.

Efforts and investment will be required to develop an internationally-agreed standard and definition of sexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries.

Regularity of data production:

Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women and girls. Obtaining data on violence against women and girls is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other surveys. Not all VAW surveys, however, collect information on non-intimate partner violence. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available."	Agency

49	78	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Violence against women is a serious problem that affects women globally. It is a violation of women’s human rights and has negative consequences for their physical emotional and social wellbeing and ability to participate in civil society. On a broader scale violence against women interferes with the social economic and political development of societies.The experience of violence can affect women in a myriad of ways. Injuries and health problems are common as a result of physical and sexual violence but the psychological and emotional wounds they may also inflict are sometimes deeper and longer lasting. Violence can lead to a reduced ability of a woman to work care for her family and contribute to society. Witnessing violence in childhood can also result in a range of behavioural and emotional problems.Violence against women also incurs significant economic costs both direct and indirect. Direct costs include those associated with the police hospital and other health services legal costs and costs associated with housing social and support services. Indirect costs include those related to reduced employment and productivity and the diminished value of a life lived with violence.	Agency

The main sources of intimate partner violence prevalence data are (1) specialized national surveys dedicated to measuring violence against women and (2) international household surveys that include a module on experiences of violence by women, such as the DHS.

Although administrative data from health, police, courts, justice and social services, among other services used by survivors of violence, can provide information on violence against women and girls, these do not produce prevalence data, but rather incidence data or number of cases received in/reported to these services. We know that many abused women do not report violence and those who do, tend to be only the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data should not be used as a data source for this indicator.

Proportion of girls and women aged 15-49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting is currently being measured by the proportion of girls aged 15-19 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting

  Rationale: 

FGM/C is a violation of girls’ and women’s human rights. There is a large body of literature documenting the adverse health consequences of FGM/C over both the short and long term. The practice of FGM/C is a direct manifestation of gender inequality 

FGM/C is condemned by a number of international treaties and conventions. Since FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include explicit bans against FGM/C.

  Concepts: 

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) refers to “all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" (World Health Organization, Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation: An interagency statement, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP, UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008, p.4)

Women may be unwilling to disclose having undergone FGM/C either because of sensitivity of the topic or the illegal status of the practice in the country. In addition, girls and women may be unaware that they have been cut or the extent of the cutting, especially if FGM/C was performed at an early age.	Agency

Household surveys such as UNICEF-supported MICS and DHS have been collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since the late 1980s. In some countries, such data are also collected through other national household surveys.

  Collection process: 

UNICEF undertakes an annual process to update its global databases, called Country Reporting on Indicators for the Goals (CRING). This exercise is done in close collaboration with UNICEF country offices with the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally comparable data. UNICEF Country Offices are invited to submit, through an online system, any updated data for a number of key indicators on the well-being of women and children. Updates sent by the country offices are then reviewed by sector specialists at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality of the submitted estimates. This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information is included in the databases. Once reviewed, feedback is made available on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. New data points that are accepted are then entered into UNICEF’s global databases and published in the State of the World’s Children statistical tables, as well as in all other data-driven publications/material. The updated databases are also posted online at data.unicef.org.

UNICEF also searches throughout the year for additional sources of data that are vetted by the UNICEF country office before they are included in the global databases."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

52	41	2	International agreed definition	"Definition: 

Annual number of births to females aged 10-14 or 15-19 years per 1,000 females in the respective age group.

  Rationale: 

Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors underlying it are essential for improving sexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman’s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socio-economic improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services.

  Concepts: 

The adolescent birth rate represents the risk of childbearing among females in the particular age group. The adolescent birth rate among women aged 15-19 years is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19.

  Comments and limitations: 

Discrepancies between the sources of data at the country level are common and the level of the adolescent birth rate depends in part on the source of the data selected. 

For civil registration, rates are subject to limitations which depend on the completeness of birth registration, the treatment of infants born alive but die before registration or within the first 24 hours of life, the quality of the reported information relating to age of the mother, and the inclusion of births from previous periods. The population estimates may suffer from limitations connected to age misreporting and coverage.

For survey and census data, both the numerator and denominator come from the same population. The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling variability in the case of surveys.

With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20–24 years. 

The adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates. It has also been called adolescent fertility rate. A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
52	41	3	Method of computation	"Computation Method: 

The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and census data.

In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.

In the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.

With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census.

If data are available, adolescent fertility at ages 10-14 years can also be computed. 

For a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see Handbook on the Collection of Fertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11, (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF\_92E.pdf). Indirect methods of estimation are analyzed in Manual X: Indirect Techniques for Demographic Estimation, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.83.XIII.2. (http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/Manual\_X/Manual\_X.htm)."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
52	41	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Women who become mothers very early frequently miss out on education and socio-economic opportunities. Thus, high adolescent birth rates may contribute to a large gender gap in education. High adolescent birth rates also indicate a prevalence of early marriages among women, and are often a sign of a social structure in which women are expected to affirm their adulthood by assuming their social role as mothers as early as possible. As such, declining adolescent birth rates can indicate increasing gender equality and women’s empowerment. A high adolescent birth rate can also contribute to high maternal mortality.	Agency
52	41	5	Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures	"Sources of discrepancies: 

Estimates based on civil registration are only provided when the country reports at least 90 per cent coverage and when there is reasonable agreement between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Small discrepancies might arise due to different denominators or the inclusion of births to women under 15 years of age. Survey estimates are only provided when there is no reliable civil registration. There might be discrepancies on the dating and the actual figure if a different reference period is being used. In particular, many surveys report rates both for a three-year and a five-year reference period. For countries where data are scarce, reference periods located more than five years before the survey might be used."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/
52	41	6	Process of obtaining data	"Description: 

Civil registration is the preferred data source. Census and household survey are alternate sources when there is no reliable civil registration.

Data on births by age of mother are obtained from civil registration systems covering 90 per cent or more of all live births, supplemented eventually by census or survey estimates for periods when registration data are not available. For the numerator, the figures reported by National Statistical Offices to the United Nations Statistics Division have first priority. When they are not available or present problems, use is made of data from the regional statistical units or directly from National Statistical Offices. For the denominator, first priority is given to the latest revision of World Population Prospects produced by the Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations. In cases where the numerator does not cover the complete de facto population, an alternative appropriate population estimate is used if available. When either the numerator or denominator is missing, the direct estimate of the rate produced by the National Statistics Office is used. Information on sources is provided at the cell level. When the numerator and denominator come from two different sources, they are listed in that order.

In countries lacking a civil registration system or where the coverage of that system is lower than 90 per cent of all live births, the adolescent birth rate is obtained from household survey data and census data. Registration data regarded as less than 90 per cent complete are exceptionally used for countries where the alternative sources present problems of compatibility and registration data can provide an assessment of trends. In countries with multiple survey programmes, large sample surveys conducted on an annual or biennial basis are given precedence when they exist.

For information on the source of each estimate, see United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2015). World Fertility Data 2015 (POP/DB/Fert/Rev2015). http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/fertility/wfd2015.shtml

  Collection process: 

For civil registration data, data on births or the adolescent birth rate are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC). The population figures are obtained from the last revision of the United Nations Population Division World Population Prospects and only exceptionally from other sources.

Survey data are obtained from national household surveys that are internationally coordinated—such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)—and other nationally-sponsored surveys. Other national surveys conducted as part of the European Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) or the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM) may be considered as well. The data are taken from published survey reports or, in exceptional cases, other published analytical reports. Whenever the estimates are available in the survey report, they are directly taken from it. If clarification is needed, contact is made with the survey sponsors or authoring organization, which occasionally may supply corrected or adjusted estimates in response. In other cases, if microdata are available, estimates are produced by the Population Division based on national data.

For census data, the estimates are preferably directly obtained from census reports. In such cases, adjusted rates are only used when reported by the National Statistical Office. In other cases, the adolescent birth rate is computed from tables on births in the preceding 12 months by age of mother, and census population distribution by sex and age. 

In addition to obtaining data and estimates directly from the websites of National Statistical Offices, the following databases and websites are utilized: the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) (http://api.dhsprogram.com/\#/index.html), Demographic Yearbook database of the Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (http://data.un.org), internal databases of the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (see latest public release here: http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/fertility/wfd2015.shtml), Eurostat (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), the Human Fertility Database (http://www.humanfertility.org), the Human Fertility Collection (http://www.fertilitydata.org), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (http://mics.unicef.org/). Survey databases (e.g., the Integrated Household Survey Network (IHSN) database) are also consulted in addition to searches for data on websites of National Statistical Offices and ad hoc queries."	https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/

Gender inequalities in all these areas are associated with traditions and stereotypes (influencing the choice of education, professions and career paths of women and men) and the difficulties in balancing work and family life that often lead to part-time work and career breaks, mainly for women. The wage gap may reflect not only differences in occupation and sectoral segregation and number of hours worked, but also gender discrimination in payment for the same job.(World's Women 2015: Trends and Statistics)	Agency

55	59	2	International agreed definition	ILO convention 156 on workers with family responsibility aims to promote equality of opportunity and treatment in the labour market for women and men with family responsibilities. The convention is to create effective equality of opportunity and treatment as between men and women workers with family responsibilities and between such workers and other workers.  The convention applies to women and men workers with responsibilities with their dependent children, or with other members of their immedidate family who clearly need their care or support.

55	59	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Women are the primary caretakers of the family (United Nations World's Women 2015: Trends and Statistics). Caring for children and other dependent household members, preparing meals, cleaning and repairing are tasks disproportionately carried out by women. In many countries, more than half of women’s total work time is spent on unpaid domestic work.  Women tend to temporarily withdraw from the labour force and to seek shorter hours or other flexible working arrangements during childbearing and the first years of life of their children. The convention provides information on whether a country has the enabling environment to promote nondiscrimination in the labour market for those with family responsibilities.	Agency

55	60	2	International agreed definition	"ILO convention 175 on part-time work was created, recognising the importance of productive and freely chosen employment for all workers, the economic importance of part-time work, the need for employment policies to take into account the role of part-time work in facilitating additional employment opportunities, and the need to ensure protection for part-time workers in the areas of access to employment, working conditions and social security.  The term ""part-time worker"" means an employed person whose normal hours of work are less than those of comparable full-time workers.  The term ""comparable full-time worker"" refers to a full-time worker who: (i) has the same type of employment relationship; (ii) is engaged in the same or a similar type of work or occupation; and (iii) is employed in the same establishment or, when there is no comparable full-time worker in that establishment, in the same enterprise or, when there is no comparable full-time worker in that enterprise, in the same branch of activity.

55	60	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Part-time work may offer an effective way to balance time spent on paid work, household responsibilities and childrearing. The possibility of being able to work for fewer hours is also seen as a means to increase employment levels, particularly among women. In addition, part-time work facilitates the gradual entry into, participation in and exit from the labour market. Women are more likely than men to be engaged in part-time employment. However, part-time work also comes at a cost. Part-time workers face difficult working conditions, including lower hourly wages and lesser job security, and receive less training and promotion opportunities than their full-time counterparts. They are also at a higher risk of falling into poverty and are less likely to have access to social protection such as unemployment benefits. Some forms of part-time work in developed countries are non-standard types of work with employment conditions similar to those described for informal employment.

55	61	2	International agreed definition	"ILO convention 177 on home work was created to improve the employment situation of homeworkers.  The term ""home work"" means work carried out by a person, to be referred to as a homeworker, (i) in his or her home or in other premises of his or her choice, other than the workplace of the employer; (ii) for remuneration; (iii) which results in a product or service as specified by the employer, irrespective of who provides the equipment, materials or other inputs used, unless this person has the degree of autonomy and of economic independence necessary to be considered an independent worker under national laws, regulations or court decisions. Member states ratified the Convention shall adopt and implement national policy on home work aimed improving the situation of homeworkers, promoting as much as possible equality of treatment between homeworkers and other wage earners, taking into account the special characteristics of home work and, where appropriate, conditions applicable to the same or a similar type of work carried out in an enterprise.

55	61	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Women are over-represented among homeworkers engaged in manual work. Women are more likely than men to work mainly at home; women are more likely than men to work at home in manual activities. Homeworkers face many common challenges, as well as challenges that differ according to their employment status. Because of their Homeworkers are largely invisible and in isolation, most are unorganized and therefore are not able to bargain with their employers (or intermediaries) for wages, with local authorities for infrastructure and services, or about prices with suppliers. On average they earn very little, especially those working on a piece rate system. Homeworkers are dependent on contractors and intermediaries for orders and for payment. Orders are often irregular and their payments slow to come. Homeworkers generally have little or no protection through labour law or social protection measures. Even where they are producing on order from a business, and should be entitled to conditions equal to those of other workers in the industry, often their real employer is unknown to them and they generally remain without worker benefits and protections.  As the home is the workplace for home-based workers, inadequate housing and poor services affect their ability to work productively and also affect members of the family. Another challenging issue is health and safety. Homeworkers are exposed to many hazards: some are exposed to dangerous chemicals, others develop posture problems and so on.

62	69	2	International agreed definition	The violence against women data refer to the existence of laws in relation to broad categories of violence: domestic violence, sexual harassment and marital rape . Domestic violence ‘includes a range of sexually, psychologically and physically coercive acts used against adult and adolescent women by a current or former intimate partner, without her consent’ (UN General Assembly 2006, 37). The data refer to instances where domestic, family or intimate partner violence is specifically criminalized or where provisions for protection orders are in place.  Sexual harassment is defined as: ‘Unwelcome sexually determined behaviour, in both horizontal and vertical relationships, including in employment (including the informal employment sector), education, receipt of goods and services, sporting activities, and property transactions’ (UN DESA-DAW 2009a, 28). The data refer to whether countries have laws in place that prohibit sexual harassment under civil or criminal law, specifically in relation to employment. Voluntary guidelines or policies are not counted. Marital rape, also called spousal rape, is non-consensual sex where the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. Although general rape laws (except where exemption of a spouse is explicitly stated) do not preclude a spouse from being prosecuted, the data refer to instances where the law explicitly criminalizes marital rape, without qualifications, for example by ‘providing that sexual assault provisions apply “irrespective of the nature of the relationship” between the perpetrator and complainant; or ‘stating that “no marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defence to a charge of sexual assault under the legislation”’(UN DESA-DAW 2009a, 26). In other instances, a marital (or equivalent) relationship may be explicitly cited in the law as an aggravating factor. Explicit criminalization of marital rape is recommended as best practice by, among others, the Council of Europe (Council of Europe 2009c).	Agency

Agency
62	69	4	Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation	Domestic violence is recognized in international law as a violation of human rights. In the 1990’s domestic violence began to receive more explicit attention with the passage of the General Comment No. 19 by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (1992) and the Declaration of Elimination of Violence Against Women (1993). The past two decades have also seen numerous resolutions from the UN General Assembly on violence against women, including one that specifically addressed domestic violence.	Agency

Access to assets through inheritance is particularly important for widows, who may depend on inheritance for economic security and survival.
