## International agreed definition

This is the percentage of individuals using the Internet from any location. Until 2013 the reference period used for this indicator was the last 12 months. In 2013, the definition has been updated and the reference period is now the last three months. The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used \(not assumed to be only via a computer - it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.\). Access can be via a fixed or mobile network.

## Method of computation

The proportion of individuals using the Internet is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope individuals using the Internet by the total number of in-scope individuals, and then multiplying the result by 100.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Internet use data disaggregated by sex is key in ensuring that realities of both men and women are reflected in gender-inclusive policies. Having access and making use of Internet allow citizens to benefit from the extensive amount of services, applications and information available on the Internet, which have the potential of empowering citizens. Women have a particular potential of benefiting from the use of Internet, since they can for example use it as a platform for entrepreneurship or self-employment, to do formal e-learning or to get information about health related issues or any general topic of interest, especially for those who due to home and family duties cannot travel to places where employment opportunities, face-to-face education or health care is available. However, this implies that women should be able to have access from home or from a nearby place, which is not the case for many of them in the developing world. Women can also take advantage of Internet to express their views on civil and political issues via websites \(e.g. blogs, social networks, etc\) or take part in on-line consultations or voting to define civic or political issues \(e.g. urban planning, signing a petition\).

## Process of obtaining data

Data on individuals using the Internet disaggregated by sex are collected through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices \(NSO\). In this questionnaire, ITU collects total estimates. Percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years' data and situation of the country for other related indicators \(ICT and economic\). Data coming from surveys are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly comparable.

## Treatment of missing values

No treatment is done for missing data disaggregated by sex as the indicator is calculated only in the year for which a suitable survey data are available. Data estimates at the country level can be sporadically produced by ITU for the purpose of estimating global aggregate figures but these are not released at the country level. The method used is hot-deck imputations, for example using nearest neighbor analysis. Estimates are done for the main indicator including both sexes, but not for each sex, that is, for the percentage of individuals using the Internet. ITU uses imputation methods that consider several other indicators such as the number of fixed \(wired\)-broadband subscriptions, active mobile broadband subscriptions, households with Internet and the income of the country.

## Data availability and assessment of countriesï¿½ capacity

Data on mobile telephone users disaggregated by sex is available for about 70 countries in the world but not for each year. Data availability depends very much on the availability of household surveys and the willing of National Statistics Office to include the indicator in their surveys. The methodology of surveys in which these data is collected is analyzed by ITU when the data and metadata is received. The survey methodology needs to have minimum quality standards \(adequate sample design, acceptable standard error, small proportion of non-response or adequate non-response treatment, etc.\) in order for ITU to integrate the results in the database.

## Expected time of release

Data is released in December through the World Telecommunication and ICT Indicators Database. Data for the latest available year are also available at no cost through the ITU's statistics page, see: [http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics](http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics) . However, release of new data for a country will depend on availability of new household surveys including the related question.
