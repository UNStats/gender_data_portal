## International agreed definition

The average number of remaining years of life expected by a hypothetical cohort of males or females alive at age 60 who would be subject during the remainder of their lives to the age- and sex-specific mortality rates of a given period. It is expressed in years.

## Method of computation

Age- and sex-specific mortality rates are used to construct mortality life tables, from which life expectancies at specific ages are derived.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Women tend to live longer than men in all regions of the world. In nearly all countries of the world, female life expectancy at age 60 is higher than that of males; however, there are differences in the gap between female and male life expectancy by development group or region. At the world level, 60-year-old women have a life expectancy of 22.3 years in 2015-2020, compared to 19.1 years for 60-year-old men. The female advantage is considerably larger in the more developed regions \(3.9 years\) compared to the less developed regions \(2.6 years\). The gap between male and female life expectancy at age 60 is particularly narrow in the least developed countries \(1.8 years\). The indicator reflects possible gender differences in determinants of health and mortality at ages above 60, including prevalence of smoking, obesity, limited physical activity or ability of older women and men to access health care, among others.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

National demographic statistics can be affected by incompleteness of coverage, lack of timeliness and errors in the reporting or coding of the information. For the World Population Prospects, the analysis carried out by the Population Division uses the cohort-component method to reconstruct populations to ensure that the population trends and related estimates of fertility, mortality and migration are internally consistent. For many countries without complete and reliable death registration systems, national estimates of mortality above age 60 are not available. In these cases, a model life table age pattern of mortality is used to derive estimates of mortality rates above age 60. National estimates that use different methods to account for deficiencies of age-and sex-specific mortality data may be different from the life expectancy at age 60 published by the Population Division.

## Process of obtaining data

In countries with well-developed data systems, mortality rates at ages above 60 can be measured using data from civil registration systems and population estimates derived from censuses or population registers. In many countries, however, the estimation of mortality rates above age 60 is seriously constrained by the absence of reliable, continuous, and complete data registration systems. Throughout many countries where such systems are not in place, valid measures of mortality above age 60 are not available. Other sources of information have to be incorporated, such as estimates of adult mortality below age 60 and/or child mortality estimates, which are then applied to a model life table age pattern of mortality to derive estimates of mortality rates above age 60.  Empirical observations on deaths by age and sex and age- and sex-specific mortality estimates are taken from various sources: \(a\) For countries with death registration systems, data on deaths by age and sex are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units \(ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC\). Other sources, such as data reported on the national statistics website and mortality estimates from the [Human Mortality Database](www.mortality.org) or research publications are also used. \(b\) For survey data, the information for calculation of adult mortality estimates below age 60 or 50 can be obtained from surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys \(DHS\), the Reproductive Health Surveys \(RHS\), MICS and other nationally sponsored surveys. To derive estimates for adult mortality after age 60, model life table age pattern need to be employed. \(c\) For census data, the data on deaths by age and sex in the last 12 or 24 months are obtained from census reports. Estimates of age-specific mortality rates from the census data are calculated by the Population Division or are obtained from census reports and research publications.

## Treatment of missing values

Due to the lack of valid measures of mortality above age 60 for many countries, the levels and trends in life expectancy above age 60 described in World Population Prospects, are in some cases derived from estimates of adult mortality below age 60 and/or child mortality applied to a model life table age pattern of mortality, rather than an empirical observation of deaths above age 60.
