## International agreed definition

**Definition**:

This indicator conveys the proportion of youth \(aged 15-24 years\) not in education, employment or training \(also known as "the youth NEET rate"\). It is also an SDG indicator 8.6.1.

**Concepts**:

For the purposes of this indicator, youth is defined as all persons between the ages of 15 and 24 \(inclusive\). According to the International Standard Classification of Education \(ISCED\), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short reference period \(one week\), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. For the purpose of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers.

## Method of computation

The Youth NEET rate is calculated by subtracting the sum of _Youth in employment_ and _Youth not in employment but in education or training_ from _Youth_, and the dividing the value by _Youth_, and then multiplying by 100. It is important to note here that youth simultaneously in employment and education or training should not be double counted when subtracted from the total number of youth. The formula can also be expressed as:

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

**Rationale**:

The share of youth not in employment, education or training \(youth NEET rate\) provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, not in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure of potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. It includes discouraged worker youth as well as those who are outside the labour force due to disability or engagement in household chores, among other reasons. Youth NEET is also a better measure of the current universe of potential youth labour market entrants as compared with the youth inactivity rate, as the latter includes those youth who are outside the labour force and are in education, and thus are furthering their skills and qualifications.

**Comment and limitations**:

The calculation of this indicator requires to have reliable information on both the labour market status and the participation in education or training of young persons. The quality of such information is heavily dependent on the questionnaire design, the sample size and design and the accuracy of respondents' answers. In terms of the analysis of the indicator, in order to avoid misinterpreting it, it is important to bear in mind that it is composed of two different sub-groups \(unemployed youth not in education or training and youth outside the labour force not in education or training\). The prevalence and composition of each sub-group would have policy implications, and thus should also be considered when analysing the NEET rate.

## Process of obtaining data

The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household survey with an appropriate employment module may be used to obtain the required data. The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey microdatasets in line with internationally-agreed indicator concepts and definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country \(national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.\) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.
