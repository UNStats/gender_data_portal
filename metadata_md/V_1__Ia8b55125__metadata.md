## International agreed definition

**Definition**

This indicator measures the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older who have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner, in the previous 12 months. Definition of violence against women and girls and of the forms of violence specified under this indicator are presented in the next section \(Concepts\). NOTE: We refer to �violence against women� throughout, and this also includes adolescent girls \(15-19 years old\).

**Concepts**

According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women \(1993\), violence against women is �Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family [�]�. See here for full definition: [https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104](https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104) Intimate partner violence against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: 1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. 2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior that is imposed on someone, whether by use of physical force, intimidation or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts \(intercourse\) without consent \(rape or attempted rape\), non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly operationally defined in surveys as: being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading. 3. Psychological violence consists of any act that induces fear or emotional distress. It includes a range of behaviors that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours \(e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission\). These are also considered acts of psychological abuse. For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys \(UN, 2014\), and the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes ICCS \(UNODC, 2015\), and Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018. Global, regional and national prevalence estimates for intimate partner violence against women and global and regional prevalence estimates for non-partner sexual violence against women \(WHO, 2021\).

## Method of computation

This indicator calls for breakdown by form of violence and by age group. Countries are encouraged to compute prevalence data for each form of violence as detailed below to assist comparability at the regional and global levels: Physical intimate partner violence = {Number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\) who experience physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months / number of ever-partnered women and girls \(aged 15 years and above\) in the population} x 100 Sexual intimate partner violence = {Number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\) who experience sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months / number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\) in the population} x 100 Psychological intimate partner violence = {Number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\) who experience psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months / number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\)} x 100 Any form of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence = {Number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\) who experience physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months / number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\)} x 100 Any form of physical, sexual and/or psychological intimate partner violence: {Number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\) who experience physical, sexual and/or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months / number of ever-partnered women \(aged 15 years and above\)} x 100 NOTE: To assist comparability at the regional and global level, and due to more comparable data available, countries are encouraged to additionally compute the above figures for ever-partnered women aged 15 to 49. Regional and global reporting on this indicator currently only includes data computed by countries for #4 above \(i.e., any form of physical and/or sexual partner violence\), and for both the 15-49 and the 15 years and older age groups\). For further details, see Feasibility section below.

**Global aggregates** are weighted averages of all the countries that make up the world.

**Regional aggregates** are weighted averages of all the countries within the region. Weights used are the population of women aged 15 to 49 from the most 2019 revision of the World Population Prospects. Where data are not available for all countries in any given region, regional aggregates may still be calculated. The number of countries included in the average is clearly indicated. It should be noted that regional and global figures should be interpreted with caution, as they do not necessarily represent with accuracy the region or world as a whole, especially for regions where population coverage is below 50 per cent.

**Disaggregation**: form of violence, sex, age

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence that women face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other unions. Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality. Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk; and explore the barriers to seeking help in order to inform that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies, and developing effective responses and programmes. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and optimally target resources to maximise the effectiveness of interventions \(especially in resource-constrained setting\).

**Comments and limitations**

Comparability: The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, used different definitions of partner or spousal violence \(e.g. definitions based on severity of acts or type of violence\) and recall periods \(i.e. lifetime versus past year/12 months � and different definitions of �lifetime�\); lack of disaggregation by different forms of intimate partner violence \(physical, sexual, psychological\) and by different forms of violence and different survey question formulations, used diverse age groups, or used different denominators \(e.g. all women [various age ranges], or only ever-married/partnered or currently married/partnered women\). The quality of interviewer training also likely varies although this is difficult to quantify. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to how the survey is implemented, and the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels. Given the wide variations in methodologies, measurement and quality across studies from different countries statistically adjusted estimates are currently needed to ensure comparability across countries and regions. However, generating estimates are an interim solution and it is important for individual countries to collect robust, internationally comparable, high-quality data that reflect the relevant socioeconomic, political and cultural risk and protective factors associated with the prevalence of violence against women in order to inform appropriate policy responses and programmatic decision-making. Regularity of data production: Obtaining data on violence against women is a costly and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys \(DHS\), the main source of data for LMICs, are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted usually with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available for regular surveys. At the same time prevalence is unlikely to change from year to year so every 3-5 years is recommended.

Feasibility: This indicator calls for global reporting on three types of intimate partner violence: physical, sexual, and psychological. While there is global consensus on how physical and sexual intimate partner violence are generally defined and measured, psychological partner violence�which may be conceptualised differently across cultures and in different contexts. This indicator therefore currently reports on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to develop a global standard for measuring and reporting on psychological intimate partner violence. This will enable reporting on the three stipulated types of partner violence in the future. Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence experienced by ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above. A majority of data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49, and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports on both violence experienced by ever-partnered women 15-49 years of age and 15 years and older. Given the existing limited availability on violence against women aged 50 years and older, efforts are underway by the custodian agencies to improve the measurement and encourage increased availability of data on violence against women aged 50 years and older. This will enable a better estimating the extent of this problem and understanding the experiences of partner violence for this older age group.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

All available survey data sources that are representative at the national and subnational level, are used to generate the prevalence estimates. The data are from published survey reports and/or data and datasets provided by countries. In cases where only data disaggregated by violence type were presented in the report, microdata was used to calculate the aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence. As there is variability in the measurement across surveys and countries, relevant covariate adjustments were made to enhance comparability. These include adjustments for case definitions \(e.g. severity\), type of violence \(i.e. physical intimate partner violence only or sexual intimate partner violence only\), population surveyed \(e.g. currently married women only or all women\), reference partners \(e.g. current/most recent partners\), and geographical strata \(rural or urban\), aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence where only one of the two forms were available.

## Process of obtaining data

It comprises data from population-based household surveys representative at the national and/or sub-national level and implementing a methodology that uses act-based questions. All sources date from 2000 onwards. A significant proportion of data, especially for low- and middle-income countries are obtained from the Domestic Violence Module Demographic and Health Surveys \(DHS\). Some data come from dedicated surveys on violence against women in countries that have implemented, for example, WHO�s violence against women survey methodology or other methodologies consistent with international guidelines and best practice. In the case of some higher-income countries, data were also obtained from Crime Victimisation Surveys \(CVS\). Data are collated by the WHO on behalf of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Women Data \(WHO, UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD, UNFPA, UNODC\) from publicly available survey data or data provided by National Statistics Offices or other relevant national entities through the consultation process with countries. For efficiency, some data are collated using existing data-compiling online platforms \(e.g., DHS StatCompiler and the EU Fundamental Rights Agency Data Explorer\).

## Treatment of missing values

**At country level**

When data for a country are entirely missing, no country-level estimate is published.

**At regional and global levels**

Imputations are made in cases where country data are not available for the purposes of regional and global figures. The number of countries included in the average and with data available is clearly indicated by SDG region.

## Data availability and assessment of countries� capacity

---

## Expected time of release

Countries are encouraged to conduct surveys in regular intervals. The recommended interval is 3 to 5 years which will allow countries to effectively measure progress. The prevalence database will be updated on an annual basis. Data were collected, compiled and sent back to countries alongside the country estimates for their review. It is expected that the modelled estimates will be updated every 2 years.
