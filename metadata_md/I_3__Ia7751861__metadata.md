## International agreed definition

The labour force participation rate is the number of persons in the labour force as a percentage of the working-age population. The labour force is the sum of the number of persons employed and the number of persons unemployed. Thus, the measurement of the labour force participation rate requires the measurement of both employment and unemployment. Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: paid employment \(whether at work or with a job but not at work\); or self-employment \(whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work\).  The unemployed comprise all persons of working age who were: without work during the reference period, i.e. were not in paid employment or self-employment; currently available for work, i.e. were available for paid employment or self-employment during the reference period; and seeking work, i.e. had taken specific steps in a specified recent period to seek paid employment or self-employment.  The working-age population is the population above the legal working age, but for statistical purposes it comprises all persons above a specified minimum age threshold for which an inquiry on economic activity is made. To promote international comparability, the working-age population is often defined as all persons aged 15 and older, but this may vary from country to country based on national laws and practices \(some countries also apply an upper age limit\).

## Method of computation

The labour force participation rate is calculated as follows: as the *labour force* divided by the *working-age population*, and then multiplied by 100; or as the *sum of persons employed and unemployed*, which is then divided by the *working-age population*, and then multiplied by 100.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

The indicator for labour force participation rate plays a central role in the study of the factors that determine the size and composition of a country’s human resources and in making projections of the future supply of labour. To some degree, the way in which the labour force is measured can have an effect on the extent to which men and women are included in labour force estimates. Unless specific probes are built into the data collection instrument, certain groups of workers may be underestimated – particularly the number of employed persons who work for only a few hours in the reference period, especially if they do not do so regularly, are in unpaid employment, or work near or in their home, thus mixing work and personal activities during the day. Since women, more so than men, are found in these situations, it is to be expected that the number of women in employment \(and thus the female labour force\) will tend to be underestimated to a larger extent than the number of men.

## Process of obtaining data

Labour force surveys are the preferred source of information for determining the labour force participation rate and related indicators. Such surveys can be designed to cover virtually the entire non-institutional population of a given country, all branches of economic activity, all sectors of the economy and all categories of workers, including the self-employed, contributing family workers, casual workers and multiple jobholders. In addition, such surveys generally provide an opportunity for the simultaneous measurement of the employed, the unemployed and persons outside the labour force in a coherent framework.  Population censuses are another major source of data on the labour force and its components. The labour force participation rates obtained from population censuses, however, tend to be lower, as census forms do not typically allow for detailed probing on the labour market activities of the respondents.
