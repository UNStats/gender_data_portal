## International agreed definition

Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: a) paid employment \(whether at work or with a job but not at work\); or b) self-employment \(whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work\). The working-age population is the population above the legal working age, but for statistical purposes it comprises all persons above a specified minimum age threshold for which an inquiry on economic activity is made. To promote international comparability, the working-age population is often defined as all persons aged 15 and older, but this may vary from country to country based on national laws and practices \(some countries also use an upper age limit\). The classification by status in employment refers to inherent characteristics of the jobs held by the employed population. Jobs can be classified with respect to the type of explicit or implicit contract of employment the person has with other persons or organizations. The basic criteria used to define the groups of the classification are the type of economic risk and the type of authority over establishments and other workers which the job incumbents have. Data presented by status in employment is based on the 1993 International Classification of Status in Employment \(ICSE-93\). The ICSE-93 classifies jobs into five main categories, which can be grouped under two main types of jobs: paid employment jobs \(employees\) and self-employment jobs \(employers, own-account workers, contributing family workers and members of producers� cooperatives\). A sixth category is reserved for workers not classifiable by status. Contributing family workers are those workers who hold �self-employment jobs� as own-account workers in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same household.

## Method of computation

The proportion of employed who are contributing family workers is calculated by expressing the number of contributing family workers as a percentage of the total employed population.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

This indicator, together with �Proportion of employed who are contributing family workers, by sex� and �Proportion of employed who are employer, by sex�, provides information on the distribution of the workforce by status in employment by sex. Breaking down employment information by status in employment provides a statistical basis for describing workers� behaviour and conditions of work, and for defining an individual�s socio-economic group. The discrepancy of gender in the employment status can reveal the social inequality problem. A number of factors can limit the comparability of statistics on status in employment between countries or over time. Comparability of employment statistics across countries is affected most significantly by variations in the definitions used for the employment figures. Differences can result from age coverage, such as the lower and upper bounds for labour force activity. Estimates of employment are also likely to vary according to whether members of the armed forces are included. Another area with scope for measurement differences has to do with the national treatment of particular groups of workers. The international definition of employment calls for inclusion of all persons who worked for at least one hour during the reference period. Workers could be in paid employment or in self-employment, including in less obvious forms of work, some of which are dealt with in detail in the resolution adopted by the 19th ICLS, such as unpaid family work, apprenticeship or non-market production. The majority of exceptions to coverage of all persons employed in a labour force survey have to do with national variations to the international recommendation applicable to the alternate employment statuses. Comparisons can also be problematic when the frequency of data collection differs. The range of data collection can run from one month to 12 months in a year. Given the fact that seasonality of various kinds is undoubtedly present in all countries, employment figures can vary for this reason alone. Some countries group together some of the ICSE categories \(including for example members of producers� cooperatives with wage and salaried workers, or own-account workers with employers\), affecting the comparability of the statistics. Importantly, the classification by status in employment does not provide information about finer distinctions in working status \(for instance, whether workers have casual or regular contracts and the kind of protection the contracts provide against dismissals\).

## Process of obtaining data

Labour force surveys are the preferred source of information on status in employment. Such surveys can be designed to cover virtually the entire non-institutional population of a given country, all branches of economic activity, all sectors of the economy and all categories of workers, including the self-employed, contributing family workers, casual workers and multiple jobholders. In addition, such surveys generally provide an opportunity for the simultaneous measurement of the employed, the unemployed and persons outside the labour force \(and thus, the working-age population\) in a coherent framework. Other types of household surveys and population censuses can also be used as sources of data on status in employment. The information obtained from such sources may however be less reliable since they do not typically allow for detailed probing on the labour market activities of the respondents.
