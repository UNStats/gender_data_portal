## International agreed definition

According to [ILO convention 183](http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C183) on maternity protection, women should be entitled to no less than 14 weeks of maternity leave, with paid cash benefits of at least two thirds of their previous earnings. The indicator contains detailed information on countries' maternity leave duration, whether the leave is compulsory or entitlement.

## Method of computation

The indicator contains information on both countries' maternity leave duration in weeks and detailed explanations. It is further grouped into �at least 14 weeks� and �less than 14 weeks�.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Maternity protection not only contributes to the health and well-being of mothers and babies; it also promotes effective gender equality at work. Three maternity protection conventions were adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1919, 1952 and 2000. The latest one is the Maternity Protection Convention (No. 183), adopted in 2000, which stipulates that women should be entitled to no less than 14 weeks of maternity leave, with paid cash benefits of at least two thirds of their previous earnings. This convention is also accompanied by Recommendation (No. 191) which advises that Members should endeavour to extend the period of maternity leave to at least 18 weeks and that cash benefits should be raised to the full amount of the woman�s previous earnings or of such of those earnings as are taken into account for the purpose of computing benefits.
