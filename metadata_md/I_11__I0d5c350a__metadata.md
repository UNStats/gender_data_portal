## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Access to formal financial services such as savings, insurance, payments, credit and remittances is essential to the ability of people—regardless of income level, gender, age, education or where they live— to manage their lives, build their futures, and grow their businesses.

## Process of obtaining data

The indicators in the 2014 Global Financial Inclusion \(Global Findex\) database are drawn from survey data covering almost 150,000 people in more than 140 economies—representing more than 97 percent of the world’s population. The survey was carried out over the 2014 calendar year by Gallup, Inc. as part of its Gallup World Poll, which since 2005 has continually conducted surveys of approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in over 140 languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples. The target population is the entire civilian, noninstitutionalized population age 15 and above.  Global Findex is an individual level survey, measuring individual’s ownership of accounts. As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept, this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household level may measure the access to finance through another member of the household which may overestimate financial inclusion.
