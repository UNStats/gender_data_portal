## International agreed definition

**Definition** The participation rate in organized learning \(one year before the official primary entry age\), by sex is defined as the percentage of children in the given age range who participate in one or more organized learning programme, including programmes which offer a combination of education and care. Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both included. The age range will vary by country depending on the official age for entry to primary education.  **Concepts** An organized learning programme is one which consists of a coherent set or sequence of educational activities designed with the intention of achieving pre-determined learning outcomes or the accomplishment of a specific set of educational tasks.  Early childhood and primary education programmes are examples of organized learning programmes. Early childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education \(ISCED 2011\). Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children’s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation.  The official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to start primary education according to national legislation or policies. Where more than one age is specified, for example, in different parts of a country, the most common official entry age \(i.e. the age at which most children in the country are expected to start primary\) is used for the calculation of this indicator at the global level.

## Method of computation

The number of children in the relevant age group who participate in an organized learning programme is expressed as a percentage of the total population in the same age range. The indicator can be calculated both from administrative data and from household surveys. If the former, the number of enrolments in organized learning programmes are reported by schools and the population in the age group one year below the official primary entry age is derived from population estimates. For the calculation of this indicator at the global level, population estimates from the UN Population Division are used. If derived from household surveys, both enrolments and population are collected at the same time. Regional and global aggregates are calculated as weighted averages using the denominator of the indicator as the weight. Where publishable data are not available for a given country or year, values are imputed for the purpose of calculating the regional and global aggregates. **Disaggregation**: by sex

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

**Rationale** The indicator measures children’s exposure to organized learning activities in the year prior to the start of primary school. A high value of the indicator shows a high degree of participation in organized learning immediately before the official entrance age to primary education. **Comments and limitations** Participation in learning programmes in the early years is not full time for many children, meaning that exposure to learning environments outside of the home will vary in intensity. The indicator measures the percentage of children who are exposed to organized learning but not the intensity of the programme, which limits the ability to draw conclusions on the extent to which this target is being achieved. More work is needed to ensure that the definition of learning programmes is consistent across various surveys and defined in a manner that is easily understood by survey respondents, ideally with complementary information collected on the amount of time children spend in learning programmes.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

Nationally-published figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between national education systems and the International Standard Classification of Education \(ISCED\); or differences in coverage \(i.e. the extent to which different types of education – e.g. private or special education – are included in one rather than the other\) and/or between national and the United Nations Population Division \(UNPD\) population estimates.

## Process of obtaining data

Administrative data from schools and other centres of organized learning or from household surveys on enrolment by single year of age in early learning programmes; population censuses and surveys for population estimates by single year of age \(if using administrative data on enrolment\); administrative data from ministries of education on the official entrance age to primary education. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics produces time series based on enrolment data reported by Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices and population estimates produced by the UN Population Division. The enrolment data are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in the International Standard Classification of Education \(ISCED\) to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators. The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made \(of errors\) or explanations given \(of implausible but correct results\). During this process countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items. In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual “country review” of indicators.
