## International agreed definition

Total enrolment in tertiary education regardless of age expressed as a percentage of the population in the 5-year age group immediately following upper secondary education.

---

## Method of computation

Number of students enrolled in tertiary education, expressed as percentage of the 5-year age group immediately following upper secondary education.  If the official entrance age to upper secondary is 15 years and the duration is 3 years, then the age group is 18-22 years. The indicator should be based on total enrolment in all types of education institutions, including public and private. Disaggregation: by sex

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

A high value of the indicator shows a high degree of participation in tertiary education by students of all ages. In situations of limited resources, families make difficult choices about sending their children to school. They may perceive the value of education differently for boys and girls. Girls are more likely than boys to suffer from limited access to education, especially in rural areas. But where basic education is widely accepted and overall enrolment is high, girls tend to equal or outnumber boys at primary and secondary levels. The pattern is similar in higher education, but with larger differences between the two sexes. The gross enrolment ratio is a broad measure of participation in tertiary education and does not take account of differences in duration of programmes between countries or between different levels of education and fields of study. It is standardised to some extent by measuring it relative to a 5-year age group for all countries but may underestimate participation especially in countries with poorly developed tertiary education systems or those where provision is limited to first tertiary programmes \(which are generally shorter than 5 years in duration\).
