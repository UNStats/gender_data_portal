## International agreed definition

�Professional Judges or Magistrates� means both full-time and part-time officials as of 31 December authorized to hear specifically criminal cases, including in appeal courts, and to make dispositions in a court of law. Also includes authorized associate judges and magistrates. Data refer to 'Female Professional Judges or Magistrates at the national level'.

## Method of computation

It is recommended to compute the percentage female as female/\(male+female\) rather than female/total, as the sum of \(male+female\) in some cases is smaller than the total \(there are some judges/magistrates of unknown sex\)

---

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

For a number of reasons, the share of female judges and magistrates in many countries is relatively high, compared to the share of female police personnel, or other law enforcement agencies with available data, indicating that this is an area relatively accessible and attractive for female candidates.
