## International agreed definition

The indicator on proportion of adults who are obese, by sex is defined as proportion of people who are of age 20 and over and who have a body mass index \(BMI\) of 30 kg/m2 and over.

---

## Method of computation

BMI is calculated as weight \(in kilograms\) divided by the square of height \(in meters\). BMI is calculated based on measured, rather than self-reported height and weight, to avoid systematic reporting biases.

**Disaggregation**: by sex

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Excess bodyweight is an important risk factor for mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders. National, subnational, and multicentre studies have shown that adiposity, as measured by body-mass index \(BMI\), has increased in recent decades in many populations. Reliable information about these trends is needed to assess the implications of rising BMI on population health, set policy priorities, and evaluate their success.

## Process of obtaining data

Data are obtained based on a study carried out by WHO extracting information from national health examination surveys, epidemiological studies, multicentre studies, a review of published articles, and unpublished data. Only BMI data from measured weight and height are used because self-reported measures are systematically biased.
