## International agreed definition

The indicator on inheritance rights is based on expert responses to the following questions: Do female and male surviving spouses have equal rights to inherit assets? Do sons and daughters have equal rights to inherit assets from their parents? The answer is �Yes� if there are no differences in the rules of intestate succession for transfer of property from parents to children, or from spouse to spouse. The answer is �No� if there are gender-based differences in the inheritance rights of sons and daughters or of spouses of different sexes. Any gender-based difference would trigger a �No� answer. In addition, it is assumed that: the deceased has not left a will, so the rules of intestate succession apply when determining the inheritance rights of spouses, male and female surviving spouses do not have any living children
