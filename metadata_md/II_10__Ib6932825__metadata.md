## International agreed definition

The proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology \(ICT\) skills, by type of skill is defined as the percentage of individuals that have undertaken certain ICT-related activities in the last 3 months. The indicator is expressed as a percentage. Computer-related activities to measure ICT skills are as follows: Copying or moving a file or folder Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a document Sending e-mails with attached files \(e.g. document, picture, video\) Using basic arithmetic formulas in a spreadsheet Connecting and installing new devices \(e.g. a modem, camera, printer\) Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software Creating electronic presentations with presentation software \(including images, sound, video or charts\) Transferring files between a computer and other devices Writing a computer program using a specialized programming language A decision was made in 2018 to modify the formulation of this indicator to make the indicator independent of the device used. This data will be collected from member states from 2020 onwards, and incorporate changes to some of the skills categories. The revised and new skills categories will be: Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move data, information and content in digital environments \(e.g. within a document, between devices, on the cloud\) Sending messages \(e.g. e-mail, messaging service, SMS\) with attached files \(e.g. document, picture, video\) Using basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheet Connecting and installing new devices \(e.g. a modem, camera, printer\) through wired or wireless technologies Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software and apps Creating electronic presentations with presentation software \(including text, images, sound, video or charts\) Transferring files or applications between devices \(including via cloud-storage\) Setting up effective security measures \(e.g. strong passwords, log-in attempt notification\) to protect devices and online accounts Changing privacy settings on your device, account or app to limit the sharing of personal data and information \(e.g. name, contact information, photos\) Verifying the reliability of information found online Programming or coding in digital environments \(e.g. computer software, app development\)

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

**Rationale**

ICT skills determine the effective use of information and communication technology, so this indicator may therefore assist in making the link between ICT usage and impact. The lack of such skills continues to be one of the key barriers keeping people from fully benefitting from the potential of information and communication technologies. These data may be used to inform targeted policies to improve ICT skills, and thus contribute to an inclusive information society. This is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission \(in 2014\).

**Comments and limitations**

This indicator is relatively new but based on an internationally-agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of International Telecommunications Union \(ITU\), through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. It was also endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 20141, and again in 2020. The indicator is based on the responses provided by interviewees regarding certain activities that they have carried out in a reference period of time. However, it is not a direct assessment of skills nor do we know if those activities were undertaken effectively.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

---

## Process of obtaining data

Bodies responsible for conducting household surveys \(including National Statistical Offices and Government Ministries\) collect the use of ICT skills information. Data is compiled by ITU.

---

## Treatment of missing values

---

## Data availability and assessment of countriesï¿½ capacity

---

## Expected time of release

ITU releases data twice per year on ICT skills.

---

## Data source

Data and metadata were extracted from Global SDG Indicators Database on 20 July 2021.
