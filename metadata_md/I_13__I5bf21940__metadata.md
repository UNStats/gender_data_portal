## International agreed definition

**Definition**: This indicator provides information on the mean hourly earnings from paid employment of employees by sex, occupation, age and disability status. **Concepts**: Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers’ contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees’ gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees.

## Method of computation

Data for this indicator currently includes average hourly earnings in national currencies which are disaggregated by sex and occupation, as well as gender pay gap which is calculated as follows:  The Gender pay gap is calculated as the difference between men’s average hourly earnings and women’s average hourly earnings, which is then divided by men’s average hourly earnings and multiplied by 100.  **Disaggregation**: by sex, occupation.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Differences in pay for men and women may result from a multitude of factors. They include individual characteristics of workers, such as their level and field of education and work experience, as well as factors connected to the job they perform, such as occupation, type of contract, economic sector and size of the establishment in which they work. Gender inequalities in all these areas are associated with traditions and stereotypes \(influencing the choice of education, professions and career paths of women and men\) and the difficulties in balancing work and family life that often lead to part-time work and career breaks, mainly for women.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

Earnings statistics present a number of complications in terms of their international comparability, most of which arise from the variety of possible sources of data. The various sources available -- establishment surveys, household surveys and administrative records -- differ in their methods, objectives and scope, which influences the results obtained. The coverage of the source may vary in terms of the geographical areas covered, the workers covered \(for example, part-time workers or informal workers may be excluded\) and the establishments covered \(for example, establishments below a certain size or of a certain sector may be excluded\). In cases where the earnings of workers excluded from the coverage of the source are significantly different than those of workers included, the statistics would not be representative of the country as a whole and would not be strictly comparable to those of countries using a more comprehensive source.  When using household surveys as a source of earnings statistics, there are a number of issues related to the accuracy of the earnings information reported by the respondents. They may over declare or under declare their earnings for various reasons, or they may report gross or net wages while including or excluding bonuses and benefits, without distinction. This naturally affects the reliability of the results.

## Process of obtaining data

There are a variety of possible sources of data on employees’ earnings. Establishment surveys are usually the most reliable source, given the high accuracy of earnings figures derived from them \(the information typically comes from the payroll, so is precise\). However, the scope of these statistics is limited to the coverage of the establishment survey in question \(usually excluding small establishments, agricultural establishments and/or informal sector establishments\). Household surveys \(and especially labour force surveys\) can provide earnings statistics covering all economic activities, and all establishment types and sizes, but the quality of the data is highly dependent on the accuracy of respondents’ answers. Data on earnings could also be derived from a variety of administrative records.  The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey micro datasets in line with internationally agreed indicator concepts and definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country \(national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.\) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.
