## International agreed definition

Employment comprises all persons of working age who, during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: a) paid employment \(whether at work or having a job but not at work\); or b) self-employment \(whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work\). To promote international comparability, the working-age population is often defined as all persons aged 15 and older, but this may vary from country to country based on national laws and practices \(some countries also use an upper age limit\). The classification by economic activity refers to the main activity of the establishment in which a person worked during the reference period. The branch of economic activity of a person does not depend on the specific duties or functions of the person’s job, but rather on the characteristics of the economic unit in which the person works. Data presented by branch of economic activity is based on the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities \(ISIC\). Statistics on employment by economic activity are presented in ILOSTAT according to both the categories of the latest version of the ISIC available and aggregate categories, based on the following correspondence table: **Aggregate Economic Activity** | | | **Sections ISIC- Rev. 4** | **Sections ISIC- Rev. 3** | **Sections ISIC- Rev. 2** --------| --------|----------|-------------|------------|-----------| Agriculture | | | A | A, B | 1 Non-Agriculture | Industry | Manufacturing | C | D | 3 Non-Agriculture | Industry | Construction | F | F | 5 Non-Agriculture | Industry | Mining and quarrying; Electricity, gas and water supply | B,D,E | C,E | 2,4 Non-Agriculture | Services| Market Services \(Trade; Transportation; Accommodation and food; and Business and administrative services\) | G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N | G, H, I, J, K | 6,7,8 Non-Agriculture | Industry | Non-market services \(Public administration; Community, Social and other services and activities\) | O, P, Q, R, S, T, U | L, M, N, O, P, Q | 9 Not elsewhere classified | | | X || 0

## Method of computation

This indicator presents percentage distribution of employed population across economic sectors \(here refer to Agriculture; Industry; Services\), for each sex.

---

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

As economies develop, jobs are reallocated from agriculture and other labour-intensive primary activities to industry and finally to the services sector; in the process, workers migrate from rural to urban areas. In a large majority of countries, services are currently the largest sector in terms of employment. In most of the remaining countries, agricultural employment often remains widespread. The breakdown of the indicator by sex allows for analysis of gender segregation of employment by sector. Are men and women equally distributed across sectors, or is there a concentration of females in the services sector? Women may be drawn into lower paying service activities that allow for more flexible work schedules, thus making it easier to balance family responsibilities with work life. Segregation of women in certain sectors may also result from cultural attitudes that prevent them from taking up certain types of jobs.

## Process of obtaining data

Labour force surveys are the preferred source of information on status in employment. Such surveys can be designed to cover virtually the entire non-institutional population of a given country, all branches of economic activity, all sectors of the economy and all categories of workers, including the self-employed, contributing family workers, casual workers and multiple jobholders. In addition, such surveys generally provide an opportunity for the simultaneous measurement of the employed, the unemployed and persons outside the labour force \(and thus, the working-age population\) in a coherent framework. Other types of household surveys and population censuses can also be used as sources of data on status in employment. The information obtained from such sources may however be less reliable since they do not typically allow for detailed probing on the labour market activities of the respondents. In the absence of the above-mentioned sources, establishment surveys or administrative records can provide information on employment by economic activity, but they do not cover the entire employed population, typically excluding the informal economy, small establishments and some specific economic activities such as public administration or even in some cases agriculture.
