## International agreed definition

**ILO convention 156** on workers with family responsibilities was adopted in 1981 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The convention is to create effective equality of opportunity and treatment as between men and women workers with family responsibilities and between such workers and other workers. The convention applies to women and men workers with responsibilities with their dependent children, or with other members of their immedidate family who clearly need their care or support. **ILO convention 175** on part-time work was adopted in 1994 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), recognising the importance of productive and freely chosen employment for all workers, the economic importance of part-time work, the need for employment policies to take into account the role of part-time work in facilitating additional employment opportunities, and the need to ensure protection for part-time workers in the areas of access to employment, working conditions and social security. The term "part-time worker" means an employed person whose normal hours of work are less than those of comparable full-time workers. The term "comparable full-time worker" refers to a full-time worker who: (i) has the same type of employment relationship; (ii) is engaged in the same or a similar type of work or occupation; and (iii) is employed in the same establishment or, when there is no comparable full-time worker in that establishment, in the same enterprise or, when there is no comparable full-time worker in that enterprise, in the same branch of activity. **ILO convention 177** on home work was adopted in 1996 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to improve the employment situation of homeworkers. The term "home work" means work carried out by a person, to be referred to as a homeworker, (i) in his or her home or in other premises of his or her choice, other than the workplace of the employer; (ii) for remuneration; (iii) which results in a product or service as specified by the employer, irrespective of who provides the equipment, materials or other inputs used, unless this person has the degree of autonomy and of economic independence necessary to be considered an independent worker under national laws, regulations or court decisions. Member states ratified the Convention shall adopt and implement national policy on home work aimed improving the situation of homeworkers, promoting as much as possible equality of treatment between homeworkers and other wage earners, taking into account the special characteristics of home work and, where appropriate, conditions applicable to the same or a similar type of work carried out in an enterprise. **ILO convention 183** on maternity protection was adopted in 2000 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The Convention covers a number of aspects including protecting mother and child's health, provision of maternity leaves and leaves granted in cases of illness or complications, providing benefit during maternity leave, employment protection and non-discrimination against women during pregnancy or on maternity leave, as well as granting breaks for breastfeeding mothers.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

**ILO convention 156** Women are the primary caretakers of the family (United Nations World's Women 2015: Trends and Statistics). Caring for children and other dependent household members, preparing meals, cleaning and repairing are tasks disproportionately carried out by women. In many countries, more than half of women’s total work time is spent on unpaid domestic work. Women tend to temporarily withdraw from the labour force and to seek shorter hours or other flexible working arrangements during childbearing and the first years of life of their children. The convention provides information on whether a country has the enabling environment to promote nondiscrimination in the labour market for those with family responsibilities. **ILO convention 175** Part-time work may offer an effective way to balance time spent on paid work, household responsibilities and childrearing. The possibility of being able to work for fewer hours is also seen as a means to increase employment levels, particularly among women. In addition, part-time work facilitates the gradual entry into, participation in and exit from the labour market. Women are more likely than men to be engaged in part-time employment. However, part-time work also comes at a cost. Part-time workers face difficult working conditions, including lower hourly wages and lesser job security, and receive less training and promotion opportunities than their full-time counterparts. They are also at a higher risk of falling into poverty and are less likely to have access to social protection such as unemployment benefits. Some forms of part-time work in developed countries are non-standard types of work with employment conditions similar to those described for informal employment. (United Nations World's Women 2015: Trends and Statistics) **ILO convention 177** Women are over-represented among homeworkers engaged in manual work. Women are more likely than men to work mainly at home; women are more likely than men to work at home in manual activities. Homeworkers face many common challenges, as well as challenges that differ according to their employment status. Because of their Homeworkers are largely invisible and in isolation, most are unorganized and therefore are not able to bargain with their employers (or intermediaries) for wages, with local authorities for infrastructure and services, or about prices with suppliers. On average they earn very little, especially those working on a piece rate system. Homeworkers are dependent on contractors and intermediaries for orders and for payment. Orders are often irregular and their payments slow to come. Homeworkers generally have little or no protection through labour law or social protection measures. Even where they are producing on order from a business, and should be entitled to conditions equal to those of other workers in the industry, often their real employer is unknown to them and they generally remain without worker benefits and protections. As the home is the workplace for home-based workers, inadequate housing and poor services affect their ability to work productively and also affect members of the family. Another challenging issue is health and safety. Homeworkers are exposed to many hazards: some are exposed to dangerous chemicals, others develop posture problems and so on. (Bonner and Spooner (2012), The only school we have: learning from organizing experiences across the informal economy, Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO)). **ILO convention 183** Maternity protection not only contributes to the health and well-being of mothers and babies; it also promotes effective gender equality at work. Three maternity protection conventions were adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1919, 1952 and 2000. The latest one is the Maternity Protection Convention (No. 183), adopted in 2000, which stipulates that women should be entitled to no less than 14 weeks of maternity leave, with paid cash benefits of at least two thirds of their previous earnings.
