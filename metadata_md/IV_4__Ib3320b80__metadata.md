## International agreed definition

“Police Personnel" means personnel in public agencies as of 31 December whose principal functions are the prevention, detection and investigation of crime and the apprehension of alleged offenders. Data refer to 'Female Police Personnel at the national level'.

---

## Method of computation

It is recommended to compute the percentage female as female/\(male+female\) rather than female/total, as the sum of \(male+female\) in a few cases is smaller than the total \(there are some police personnel of unknown sex\).

---

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

It may be questioned whether the % of female police personnel should be a target of gender equality per se. In most countries the great majority of criminal offenders \(suspects\), persons convicted and persons in prisons is male \(over 90 per cent\), which may make it less attractive for women to work in this field.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

Global figures published by UNODC in its reports are based on available data for 100+ countries. The availability of additional country data may change the global picture slightly.

---

## Process of obtaining data

UNODC collects data on crime and criminal justice in its annual United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems \(UN-CTS\) from Member States.

---

## Treatment of missing values

n.a. \(in some reports a limited number of missing values may be estimated by extra- or interpolation to obtain regional or global estimates, but these are not published at the country level\)

---

## Data availability and assessment of countries’ capacity

Data on police personnel by sex are globally available for a large number of countries \(103\) covering around 3/4 of the world population. The capacity of countries to supply these data is generally considered as good.

---

## Expected time of release

Available data on police personnel are published on the old data portal [https://data.unodc.org/](https://data.unodc.org/). Updated data from the annual UN-CTS will be published in 2019 on the new data portal of UNODC: [https://dataunodc.un.org/](https://dataunodc.un.org/).
