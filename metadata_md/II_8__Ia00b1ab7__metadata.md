## International agreed definition

Number of female teachers at tertiary education, expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers at the same level of education.

---

## Method of computation

Divide the number of female teachers in tertiary education by the total number of teachers at the same level, and multiply by 100.  When calculating this indicator, care should be exercised to ensure that the number of female teachers and the total number of teachers correspond to the same type of institution, full or part-time. Such calculation should include all staff involved in teaching. Teachers are defined as persons whose professional activity involves the transmitting of knowledge, attitudes and skills that are stipulated in a formal curriculum programme to students enrolled in a formal educational institution.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

**Interpretations** To show the gender composition of the teaching force. It helps also in assessing the need for opportunities and/or incentives to encourage women to participate in teaching activities at a given level of education. Percentage of female teachers approaching 50% indicates gender parity in the composition of the teaching force. A value of greater than 50% reveals more opportunities and/or preference for women to participate in teaching activities at a specific level, grade or programme of education. **Limitations** This indicator measures the level of gender representation in the teaching profession rather than the effectiveness and quality of teaching.
