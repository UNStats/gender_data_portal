## International agreed definition

Marriage is defined as the act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of spouses is constituted. The legality of the union may be established by civil, religious or other means as recognized by the laws of each country. Age is defined as age at last birthday, that is, the difference between the date of birth and the date of the occurrence of the event, expressed in completed solar years. Countries or areas providing data on marriages by age of groom and bride have been requested to specify "the minimum legal age at which marriage can take place with and without parental consent".

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

This indicator shows the legal age at which young women can enter marriage. Social expectations often put pressure on girls to marry and begin bearing children at early ages before they are emotionally and physically ready. Adolescent girls who are married often find it difficult to access reproductive health services, negotiate the use of family planning methods with their partners, and marriage to older men may make girls more vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections and HIV.
