## International agreed definition

**Definition**

This indicator refers to the proportion of females in the total number of persons employed in managerial positions. It is recommended to use two different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females in \(total\) management and the share of females in senior and middle management \(thus excluding junior management\). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are more represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only the share of women in \(total\) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women hold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.

**Concepts**

Employment comprises all persons of working age who, during a short reference period \(one week\), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. - Employment in management is determined according to the categories of the latest version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations \(ISCO-08\), which organizes jobs into a clearly defined set of groups based on the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. For the purpose of this indicator, it is preferable to refer separately to senior and middle management only, and to total management \(including junior management\). The share of women tends to be higher in junior management than in senior and middle management, so limiting the indicator to a measure including junior management may introduce bias. Senior and middle management correspond to sub-major groups 11, 12 and 13 in ISCO-08 and sub-major groups 11 and 12 in ISCO-88. If statistics are not available disaggregated at the sub-major group level \(two-digit level of ISCO\), then major group 1 of ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 can be used as a proxy and the indicator would then refer only to total management \(including junior management\).

## Method of computation

**Using ISCO-08**

Proportion of women in senior and middle management = {\(Women employed in ISCO 08 category 1- Women employed in ISCO 08 category 14\) / \(Persons employed in ISCO 08 category 1 - Persons employed in ISCO 08 category 14\)} x 100 Which can be also expressed as: Proportion of women in senior and middle management = {\(Women employed in ISCO 08 categories 11+ 12+13\) / \(Persons employed in ISCO 08 categories 11+12+13\)} �100 And Proportion of women in management = \(Women employed in ISCO 08 category 1 / Persons employed in ISCO 08 category 1\) �100

**Using ISCO-88**

Proportion of women in senior and middle management = {\(Women employed in ISCO 88 category 1 � Women employed in ISCO 88 category 13\) / \(Persons employed in ISCO 88 category 1 - Persons employed in ISCO 88 category 13\)} �100 Which can also be expressed as: Proportion of women in senior and middle management = {\(Women employed in ISCO 88 categories 11+12\) / \(Persons employed in ISCO 88 categories 11+12\)} �100 And Proportion of women in managerial positions = \(Women employed in ISCO 88 category 1 / Persons employed in ISCO 88 category 1\) �100

**Disaggregation**:

by sex This indicator requires no disaggregation per se, although employment statistics by both sex and occupation are needed to calculate it. If statistics are available and the sample size permits, it may be of interest to cross-tabulate this indicator by economic activity \(ISIC\) or disaggregate further to observe the share of women across more detailed occupational groups.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

The indicator provides information on the proportion of women who are employed in decision-making and management roles in government, large enterprises and institutions, thus providing some insight into women�s power in decision making and in the economy \(especially compared to men's power in those areas\).

**Comments and limitations**

This indicator's main limitation is that it does not reflect differences in the levels of responsibility of women in these high- and middle-level positions or the characteristics of the enterprises and organizations in which they are employed. Its quality is also heavily dependent on the reliability of the employment statistics by occupation at the ISCO two-digit level.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

## Process of obtaining data

The recommended source for this indicator is a labour force survey or, if not available, other similar types of household surveys, including a module on employment. In the absence of any labour-related household survey, establishment surveys or administrative records may be used to gather information on the female share of employment by the required ISCO groups. In cases where establishment surveys or administrative records are used, the coverage is likely to be limited to formal enterprises or enterprises of a certain size. Information on the enterprises covered should be provided with the figures. When comparing figures across years, any changes in the versions of ISCO that are used should be taken into account. The ILO Department of Statistics processes national household survey microdatasets in line with internationally-agreed indicator concepts and definitions set forth by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians. For data that could not be obtained through this processing or directly from government websites, the ILO sends out an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country \(national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.\) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.

## Treatment of missing values

Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to impute missing values at the country level. The additional variables used for the imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market and economic data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. For a more detailed methodological description, please refer to the ILO modelled estimates methodological overview, available at [https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf](https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/TEM.pdf).
