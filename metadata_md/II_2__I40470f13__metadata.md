## International agreed definition

Total number of students of the official age group for primary education who are enrolled in any level of education, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population.

---

## Method of computation

Divide the total number of students in the official school age range for primary education who are enrolled in any level of education by the population of the same age group and multiply the result by 100. The total NER should be based on total enrolment of the official relevant school age group in any level of education for all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes. Disaggregation: by sex

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

To measure the actual school participation of official school age population for primary education. The difference between the total NER and the adjusted NER provides a measure of the proportion of children in the official relevant school age group who are enrolled in levels of education below the one intended for their age. The difference between the total NER and the adjusted NER for primary education is due to enrolment in pre-primary education. The difference between the total NER and the adjusted NER for lower secondary education is due to enrolment in pre-primary or primary education. As other net rates, the total NER is affected by the use of different reference points for age for enrolment and the population.
