## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

The evidence throughout the world illustrates that there are numerous obstacles to women's political participation and representation. Women's participation and representation in decision making bodies at executive and legislative levels has increased, but slow and uneven across the world. Increasing women's participation and representation in political life requires efforts to address political, economic, social, cultural and religious constraints within both formal and informal public and private spheres. A range of strategies such as quotas have been proposed and implemented to help increase women's representation in positions of power and decision making.  The quota system places the burden of recruitment not on the individual woman, but on those who control the recruitment process. The use of quotas is increasingly influenced by international recommendations and from cross-country inspiration. It seems important, however, that quotas are not just imposed from above, but rest on grass root mobilization of women and the active participation of women’s organizations. Quotas in themselves do not remove all the other barriers for women's full citizenship. But under certain conditions electoral gender quotas can lead to historical leaps in women’s political representation.

## Process of obtaining data

A collaborative effort of International IDEA, Inter-Parliamentary Union and Stockholm University, the Gender Quotas Database has collected data through many different sources, including, in order of authoritativeness: Constitutions and electoral laws, parliamentary websites and political party websites. The Inter-Parliamentary Union's website on women in parliaments, as the standard reference in this field, has been of great help. Many other international databases and separate websites on parliaments, political parties, and international organizations have also been consulted. Official electoral statistics on gender is not available in all countries in the world, although an increasing number of countries now comply with the demands of the international Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women \(CEDAW\) for solid gender statistics. In gathering all this information, research has been made by other scholars as well as from personal networks worldwide. In order to check and verify the information, numerous political parties, individual politicians and Electoral Management Bodies around the world have been contacted.
