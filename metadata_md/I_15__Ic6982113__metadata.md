## International agreed definition

The prime-age employment-to-population ratio is the number of persons aged 25 to 54 years who are employed as a percentage of the population aged 25 to 54 years. The types of households are classified as follows: One person Couple without children Couple with children Lone parent Extended family Total Household types are also disaggregated by the presence of children under and above age 6 or by the number of children under and above age 6. The employment-to-population ratio is the proportion of a country’s working-age population that is employed. Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: paid employment \(whether at work or with a job but not at work\); self-employment \(whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work\).

## Method of computation

The employment-to-population ratio is calculated by dividing the persons employed by the working-age population and multiplying the value by 100.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

The employment-to-population ratio provides information on the ability of an economy to create employment; for many countries the indicator is often more insightful than the unemployment rate.  It is of particular interest when broken down by sex, as the ratios for men and women can provide information on gender differences in labour markets. However, it should also be emphasized that this indicator has a gender bias insofar as there is a tendency to under-count women who do not consider their work as “employment” or are not perceived by others as “working”. Women are often the primary child caretakers and responsible for various tasks at home, which can prohibit them from seeking paid employment, particularly if they are not supported by socio-cultural attitudes and/or family-friendly policies and programmes that allow them to balance work and family responsibilities.

## Process of obtaining data

Labour force surveys are the preferred source of information for determining the employment-to-population ratio. Such surveys can be designed to cover virtually the entire non-institutional population of a given country, all branches of economic activity, all sectors of the economy and all categories of workers, including the self-employed, contributing family workers, casual workers and multiple jobholders. In addition, such surveys generally provide an opportunity for the simultaneous measurement of the employed, the unemployed and persons outside the labour force \(and thus, the working-age population\) in a coherent framework. Other types of household surveys and population censuses can also be used as sources of data to derive employment-to-population ratios. The information obtained from such sources may however be less reliable since they do not typically allow for detailed probing on the labour market activities of the respondents.
