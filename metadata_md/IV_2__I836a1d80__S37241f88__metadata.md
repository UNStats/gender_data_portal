## International agreed definition

**Definition** This indicator measures the proportion of positions held by women in local government. It is expressed as a percentage of elected positions held by women in legislative/ deliberative bodies of local government. **Concepts** Local government is one of the sub-national spheres of government and a result of decentralization, a process of transferring political, fiscal, and administrative powers from the central government to subnational units of government distributed across the territory of a country to regulate and/or run certain government functions or public services on their own. The definition of local government follows the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) distinction between central, state, and local government (para 4.129). Local government consists of local government units, defined in the SNA as �institutional units whose fiscal, legislative and executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative and political purposes� (para 4.145). What constitutes local government of a given country is defined by that country�s national legal framework, including national constitutions and local government acts or equivalent legislation. Each local government unit typically includes a legislative/ deliberative body and an executive body. Legislative/ deliberative bodies, such as councils or assemblies, are formal entities with a prescribed number of members as per national or state legislation. They are usually elected by universal suffrage and have decision-making power, including the ability to issue by-laws, on a range of local aspects of public affairs. Executive bodies, consisting of an executive committee or a mayor, may be elected, appointed or nominated and they prepare and execute decisions made by the legislative/ deliberative body. Elected positions are the most common manner of selection of local government members. They are selected in local elections, based on a system of choosing political office holders in which the voters cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The category of elected positions includes both elected persons who competed on openly contested seats and persons selected during the electoral processes on reserved seats or through a candidate quota. By comparison, members selected for appointed positions (the least common manner of selection of local government members) are nominated, typically by government officials from higher-ranking tiers of government. Appointed members of local government are more frequent among the leadership positions, such as the heads of the executive body, representatives of specific groups (e.g., women, disadvantaged groups, youth); and temporary committees/delegations/caretakers appointed by government officials when a council has been dissolved.

## Method of computation

The method of computation is as follows: {(Number of seats held by women) / (Total number of seats held by women and men)} \* 100

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

**Rationale** Women�s and men�s right to exercise their political rights on an equal basis, and at all levels of decision-making, is recognized in the SDGs and enshrined in many human and political rights declarations, conventions and resolutions agreed to by most countries in the world. �Proportion of elected seats held by women in deliberative bodies of local government� measures the degree to which gender balance has been achieved in, and women have equal access to, political decision-making in local government. It complements �Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament�, and accounts for the representation of women among the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have the potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. All tiers of local government are covered by the indicator, consistent with national legal frameworks defining local government. **Comments and limitations** This indicator refers to the representation of women among elected positions of legislative/deliberative bodies of local government. This is a strength, because it ensures comparability across countries, at low cost, and mirrors the indicator measuring women�s representation at national level, in parliament. This is also a limitation in that the indicator does not consider other positions in local government. Local government officials holding executive positions who are not simultaneously holding a position within the legislative/deliberative body, or who are appointed and not elected, are not considered in this indicator. It is recommended that women�s representation in executive positions, particularly at the level of the head of the executive (such as mayor), is monitored separately at national and global levels. Importantly, the indicator refers to representation among members of local government and not the quality of their participation. Countries may therefore consider assessing political participation through national or subnational studies involving qualitative and/or quantitative methods of research. Additional indicators of political participation may also be monitored at national level, such as women�s share among voters and candidates in local elections, to monitor the closing of other gaps in women�s political participation. Finally, aspects of local governance beyond the formal institutions of local government, such as public administration staff, are not included.

## Process of obtaining data

Administrative data based on electoral records are the main source of data on elected members of local government, and the recommended data source. Electoral records are produced and upheld by Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) or equivalent bodies tasked with organizing elections at local level. EMBs are part of the National Statistical System (NSS), and often specifically mentioned in the national statistics acts as producers of official statistics. The compilation of data, coordinated by UN Women and undertaken with the support of UN Regional Commissions, uses two mechanisms: data request forms sent to EMBs and National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly or through UN Regional Commissions on-line dissemination of data by NSS entities who are the primary source of data or in charge with coordination of SDGs, including EMBs and/or NSOs. This process will be done in a transparent manner, based on communication with NSS focal points, so that the NSS has a chance to validate or dismiss a country�s compiled data.
