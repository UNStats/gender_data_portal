## International agreed definition

Women's share of government ministerial positions is the proportion of women in ministerial positions out of the total of men and women in ministerial positions. A man or woman at the head of two or more ministries or holding several ministerial positions is counted only once. The total includes Deputy Prime Ministers/Heads of Government and Ministers. Prime Ministers/Heads of Government are also included when they hold ministerial portfolios. Heads of governmental or public agencies and Speakers of Parliament have not been included even if they have ministerial rank.

## Method of computation

Women's share of ministerial positions is derived by dividing the total number of women occupying a ministerial position by the total number of men and women occupying a ministerial position.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

The proportion of women in decision-making positions is an indicator of the degree of gender-sensitivity of political processes and actors. Recent efforts have focused more importantly on facilitating women's access to parliament. Women in the Executive have been the subject of less attention though recently several political leaders have committed to ensuring parity in government. While women in decision making positions cannot be held solely responsible for the advancement of gender equality, their level of participation contributes to setting different priorities, bringing in women's points of views and changing the way politics are made.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

The main challenge faced in collecting the data concerns definitions - i.e. what one considers as a ministerial position or not. A methodology and classification have been developed by the IPU, based on the collection of data since 2005. Differences in titles of holders of ministerial positions are linked to differences in political systems.
