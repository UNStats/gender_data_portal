## International agreed definition

Definition: This indicator is defined as the time spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 \(ICATUS 2016\) under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”. Concepts: *Unpaid domestic and care work* refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”.  As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 \(ICATUS 2016\), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017.

## Method of computation

Data presented for this indicator are expressed as the daily average number of hours. The proportion of time spent is multiplied by 24 hours to obtain the daily average time. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated as the sum of daily number of hours spent on domestic work and the daily number of hours spent on care work multiplied by 100, divided by 24. where *Daily number of hours spent on relevant activities* are calculated as the *total number of hours spent by the population on relevant activities* divided by the *total population \(regardless of whether they participated in the activity\)* If data on time spent are weekly, data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain daily time spent. **Disaggregation** Available data are currently disaggregated by sex, age and location as follows: Sex: female/ male; Age: the recommended age groups are: 15+, 15-24, 25-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65+ Location: urban/rural \(following national definitions given the lack of international definition\)

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Time use statistics have been used for: provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of individuals and households; offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality. International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including:  Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary \(light diary\) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity.  Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries.  Time-use data presented refer to the “main activity” only. Any “secondary activity” performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity.  Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.

## Process of obtaining data

Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary \(light diary\) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended \(in most of the cases based on fixed intervals\), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Most of the data are provided and validated by national statistical offices. In some cases, data have been obtained from publicly available national databases and publications. UNSD communicates with countries if there are inconsistencies or possible errors in the data.
