## International agreed definition

This indicator provides data for the total work burden of women and men \(paid and unpaid\). Paid work corresponds to the SNA production boundary and refers to work related activities in formal employment or informal employment, production of goods by households for income or for own final use, paid construction activities and construction for own capital formation and provision of services for income. those refers to work refers to the average time women and men spend on household provision of services for own consumption. Unpaid work includes both the unpaid domestic work as well as on community or volunteer work. Domestic work includes food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of a dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household members, among others. Community or volunteer work includes volunteer services for organizations, unpaid community work, and informal help to other households, among other activities. Unpaid work are not included within the SNA production boundary but are inside the SNA General Production Boundary. As much as possible, data compiled here has been based on the trial International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics \(ICATUS\), according to which paid and unpaid work are delineated by the SNA production boundary.

## Method of computation

Average number of hours spent on total work, paid and unpaid, derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either \(1\) average time spent for participants only or \(2\) average time spent for all population of certain age. In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it \(participants\). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population \(or a sub-group thereof\), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. All statistics presented in the Minimum Set on Gender Indicators on time spent in various activities are averages based on all total relevant population. This type of averages can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference \(or change\) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference \(or change\) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. Data presented for this indicator are expressed as an average per day. It is averaged over seven days of the week \(weekdays and weekends are not differentiated\). Thus, for paid work, a five-day work week averaging seven hours per day would show up as an average of five hours of paid work per day \(35 hours divided by 7 days\).

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Time-use data in general can reveal the details of an individual�s �daily life with a combination of specificity and comprehensiveness�. Time spent on domestic/unpaid work assesses intra-household allocation of time. It can help analysis study the nature and extent of intra-household inequality and the impact of that inequality. Having information about the way time is allocated among the various members of a household helps policy makers understand which household members will be most directly affected by a policy modification. International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary \(light diary\) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are not comparable. Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from the trial ICATUS, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. Time-use data presented refer to the �main activity� only. Any �secondary activity� performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. The different age groups used by countries for their data collection and compilation also makes time use data incomparable across countries.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

Not applicable.

## Process of obtaining data

Data are compiled based on statistics derived from stand-along time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level. For some countries, data are obtained from regional data compilations \(Eurostat, OECD, UNECE and UNECLAC\).

## Treatment of missing values

None.

## Data availability and assessment of countries� capacity

Since 2005, 75 countries have collected time use statistics through a time-use survey or have included a time-use module in a multipurpose household survey. Time use statistics are available at international level for 67 of them. Between 2000 and 2009, data are available for 75 countries. Since 2010, data for 49 countries are available.
