## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

For every dollar earned by men, women earn between 70 and 90 cents. Differences in pay for men and women may result from a multitude of factors. They include individual characteristics of workers, such as their level and field of education and work experience, as well as factors connected to the job they perform, such as occupation, type of contract, economic sector and size of the establishment in which they work. Gender inequalities in all these areas are associated with traditions and stereotypes (influencing the choice of education, professions and career paths of women and men) and the difficulties in balancing work and family life that often lead to part-time work and career breaks, mainly for women. The wage gap may reflect not only differences in occupation and sectoral segregation and number of hours worked, but also gender discrimination in payment for the same job. (United Nations World's Women 2015: Trends and Statistics) Women are also less likely to be employed than men. Women's work is concentrated in sectors and occupations that tend to have low pay, is subject to long hours and carries no social protection. Women are less likely to hold managerial positions, and earn less than men everywhere (United Nations World's Women 2015: Trends and Statistics). The conventions provide information on whether a country has the enabling environment to promote equal remuneration and nondiscrimination in employment and occupation for women and men.
