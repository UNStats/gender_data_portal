## International agreed definition

**Definitions**

This indicator measures government efforts to put in place legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. It is also a SDG indicator, i.e., 5.1.1. It is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women�s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family. The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing Platform for Action. Here is a sample of questions:

**Area 1: Overarching legal frameworks and public life**

**Promote**

If customary law is a valid source of law under the constitution, is it invalid if it violates constitutional provisions on equality or nondiscrimination? If personal law is a valid source of law under the constitution, is it invalid if it violates constitutional provisions on equality or nondiscrimination? Is there a discrimination law that prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination against women? Do women and men enjoy equal rights and access to hold public and political office (legislature, executive, judiciary)? Are there quotas for women (reserved seats) in,or quotas for women in candidate lists for, national parliament? Do women and men have equal rights to confer citizenship to their spouses and their children? .

**Enforce and monitor**

Does the law establish a specialized independent body tasked with receiving complaints of discrimination based on gender (e.g., national human rights institution, women�s commission, ombudsperson)? Is legal aid mandated in criminal matters? Is legal aid mandated in civil/family matters? Does a woman�s testimony carry the same evidentiary weight in court as a man�s? Are there laws that explicitly require the production and/or dissemination of gender statistics? Are there sanctions for noncompliance with mandated candidate list quotas, or incentives for political parties to field women candidates in national parliamentary elections? For the complete list of questions in all four areas, please go to: [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-01-01.pdf](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-01-01.pdf)

**Concepts**

Article 1 of CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women covering direct and indirect discrimination and article 2 sets out general obligations for States, in particular on required legal frameworks, to eliminate discrimination against women. Article 1 of CEDAW states: �... the term "discrimination against women" shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field�. The term �legal frameworks� is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms and policies/plans to �promote, enforce and monitor� gender equality. Legal frameworks that �promote� are those that establish women�s equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination on the basis of sex. Legal frameworks that �enforce and monitor� are directed to the realization of equality and non-discrimination and implementation of laws, such as policies/plans, establishment of enforcement and monitoring mechanisms, and allocation of financial resources.

## Method of computation

**Scoring**

The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality using a questionnaire comprising 42 Yes/No questions under four areas of law drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular, CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action. The answers to the questions are coded with simple �Yes/No� answers with �1� for �Yes� and �0� for �No�. For questions 1 and 2 only, they may be scored �N/A� in which case they are not included as part of the overall score calculation for the area. The score for each area is computed as number of �Yes� divided by number of questions then multiplied by 100. It therefore represents the percentage of achievement of that country in that area, with 100 being best practice met on all questions in the area. The regional and global aggregate calculations will be the unweighted average of the scores of each country in that region (or globally), per area of law.

## Importance of the indicator in addressing gender issues and its limitation

Equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex are core principles under the international legal and policy framework, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. This framework sets out the commitments of States to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality, including in the area of legal frameworks. In the Beijing Platform for Action, States pledged to revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex. The five-year review and appraisal of the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing + 5) established 2005 as the target date for the repeal of laws that discriminate against women. This deadline has come and gone. While there has been progress in reforming laws to promote gender equality, discrimination against women in the law continues in many countries. Even where legal reforms have taken place, gaps in implementation persist. Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place legal frameworks that advance gender equality are prerequisites to ending discrimination against women and achieving gender equality. This indicator will be crucial in accelerating progress on the implementation of SDG 5 and all other gender-related commitments in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To avoid duplication, the indicator does not cover areas of law that are addressed under SDG indicator 5.a.2, �Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women�s equal rights to land ownership and/or control�, and indicator 5.6.2, �Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education�. This indicator complements these other indicators.

## Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures

There should be no discrepancies. Data is collected through validated surveys.

## Process of obtaining data

The data for the indicator are derived from an assessment of legal frameworks using primary sources/official government documents, in particular laws, policies/action plans. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women�s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family. The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing Platform for Action. Countries are asked to designate a focal point to undertake the coordination at the country level necessary for the collection and validation of the data Most designated focal points are within the NWMs, a number are within the NSOs and some are within both the NWMs and the NSOs. After verification, the data with relevant laws, polices and other sources included, is sent to the designated focal points/country counterparts to review and validate. Final answers are arrived at after the process of validation with country counterparts.
